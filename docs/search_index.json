Please, note that each subsection contains a work of different authors and therefore subsections may differ at some points, for example, definitions of reproducibility used in particular studies. 1.1 Title of the article Authors: Author 1, Author 2, Author 3 (University) 1.1.1 Abstract 1.1.2 Introduction and Motivation 1.1.3 Related Work 1.1.4 Methodology 1.1.5 Results 1.1.6 Summary and conclusions 1.2 How to measure reproducibility? Classification of problems with reproducing scientific papers Authors: Paweł Koźmiński, Anna Urbala, Wojciech Szczypek (Warsaw University of Technology) 1.2.1 Abstract 1.2.2 Introduction The idea of reproducibility of scientific researches is crucial especially in the area of data science. It has become more important along with the development of methods and algorithms used in machine learning as they are more and more complex and complicated. This issue concerns users of all types: students, scientists, developers. Moreover, attaching code used in a paper, helps readers to focus on the real content rather than sophisticated explanations and descriptions included in the article. It is also valuable because the users can use the code as examples of using the package. However problem of the reproducibility is much more complex, because there is no explicit way of measuring it. It means that most of its definitions divide articles into 2 groups - reproducible and irreproducible. Thus, finding an appropriate reproducibility metrics, which would have wider set of values would result in changing the way reproducability is perceived. As a result such a metric would provide much more information for a person who would be interested in reproducing an article. 1.2.2.1 Definition Reproducibility as a problem has been addressed by scientists of various fields of studies. The exact definition also differs among areas of studies. For instance, Patrick Vandewall in 2009 suggested a definition of a reproducible research work: “A research work is called reproducible if all information relevant to the work, including, but not limited to, text, data and code, is made available, such that an independent researcher can reproduce the results” (Vandewalle, Kovacevic, and Vetterli 2009). On the other hand, Association for Computing Machinery (Computing Machinery 2018) divides the problem into three tasks as follows: * Repeatability (Same team, same experimental setup): The measurement can be obtained with stated precision by the same team using the same measurement procedure, the same measuring system, under the same operating conditions, in the same location on multiple trials. For computational experiments, this means that a researcher can reliably repeat her own computation. Replicability (Different team, same experimental setup): The measurement can be obtained with stated precision by a different team using the same measurement procedure, the same measuring system, under the same operating conditions, in the same or a different location on multiple trials. For computational experiments, this means that an independent group can obtain the same result using the author’s own artifacts. Reproducibility (Different team, different experimental setup): The measurement can be obtained with stated precision by a different team, a different measuring system, in a different location on multiple trials. For computational experiments, this means that an independent group can obtain the same result using artifacts which they develop completely independently. For the needs of this chapter we will use the Vandewalle’s definition and treat papers as fully reproducible only when they meet the conditions listed there. 1.2.3 Related Work Reproducibility is a hot topic. “Open Science in Software Engineering” (Fernández et al. 2019) describes the essence of open source, open data, open access and other openness. The article mentions that ability to reproduce work is important for the value of research. Open Science has many positive effects: increases access and citation counts, supports cooperation through open repositories. “Reproducibility Guide” (“Reproducibility in Science: A Guide to enhancing reproducibility in scientific results and writing,” n.d.) contains a lot of informations and tips on how to make research easier to reproduce. The guide also contains the list of tools that can make our research more reproducible (for example version control and automation. And the most important for us: it includes the checklist of questions that help verify the ability to reproduce. Edward Raff emphasizes the word independent in his article (Raff 2020). Independent reproducibility means that we can obtain similar results independently of the author and his code. These articles highlight various aspects of reproducibility. We want to verify how the authors care about reproducibility, what are their biggest reproduction issues and what type of problems can we encounter reproducing articles. 1.2.4 Methodology 1.2.5 Results 1.2.6 Summary and conclusions 1.3 Aging articles. How time affects reproducibility of scientific papers? Authors: Paweł Morgen, Piotr Sieńko, Konrad Welkier (Warsaw University of Technology) 1.3.1 Abstract Reproduction of a code presented in scientific papers tend to be a laborious yet important process since it enables readers a better understanding of the tools proposed by the authors. While recreating an article various difficulties are faced what can result in calling the paper irreproducible. Some reasons why such situations occur stem from the year when the article was published (for example usage of no more supported packages). The purpose of the following paper is to prove whether this is a general trend which means answering the question: is the year when the article was published related to the reproducibility of the paper. To do so a package CodeExtractorR was created that enables extracting code from PDF files. By using this tool a significant number of articles could be analyzed and therefore results received enabled us to give an objective answer to the stated question. 1.3.2 Introduction Every article published in a scientific journal is aimed at improving our knowledge in a certain field. To prove their theories, authors should provide papers with detailed, working examples and extensive supplementary materials to reproduce results. Unfortunately, these conditions are not always fulfilled. In such a case, other researchers are not able to verify and accept the solutions presented by the author. Moreover, the article is not only useless for the scientific community but also for business recipients. Over the years, several different definitions of reproducibility have been proposed. According to Gentleman and Temple Lang (2007), reproducible research are papers with accompanying software tools that allow the reader to directly reproduce methods that are presented in the research paper. Other authors suggest that scientific paper is reproducible only if text, data and code are made available and allow an independent researcher to recreate the results (Vandewalle, Kovacevic, and Vetterli 2009). Second definition emphasizes the importance of accessibility to data used in researches, therefore it seems to be more suitable and complete interpretation of reproducibility. In addition, in this article, we used scale based on the spectrum of reproducibility, proposed by Peng (2011). In his work, he also mentioned reproducibility as a minimal requirement for assessing the scientific value of the paper. In the past few years, computing has become an essential part of scientific workflow. Some best practices for writing and publishing reproducible scientific article were presented by Stodden et al. (2013). Furthermore, she made a brief overview of existing tools and software that facilitate this task. Similar issue was closely described by Kitzes, Turek, and Deniz (2017). Tools created solely for reproducibility in R were proposed by Marwick (n.d.) in package rrtools. Although many articles focus on software or framework solutions for reproducibility problems, analysis of scientific papers reproducibility in the context of release date has, to the best of the authors’ knowledge, not been described before. The intention of such research is to find correlations between age of article and its reproducibility. Authors believe that finding these dependencies will allow to calculate the estimated life span of data science article. Furthermore, as replicability helps with applying proposed methods and tools, its approximated level might be helpful in estimating usefulness of every scientific article. 1.3.3 Methodology The first issue that should be touched upon, while considering the methodology behind preparing this article, is the scale used to assess the reproducibility of the papers. In the Introduction it was already mentioned how the scale was created but a more detailed description is required. The authors decided that the scale should consist of 4 levels (from 0 up to 3): The 0 grade was given in case when no chunk of code gave the anticipated results and no figure was reproduced successfully (in practice such situation occurred mainly when the package described in the article was no more available). The 1 grade means that at least one example gave the results that the authors waited for, while it also includes situations when about half of the code in the chunks behaved as expected. The 2 grade was awarded to the articles that were reproducible “in the majority” what also means that they were not reproducible in 100%. The 3 grade was received by the articles that were fully reproducible and no problems were encountered in the process. Such a result was highly anticipated by the authors but the criteria for this grade were rather strict. The second issue that also played a vital role in the authors’ work was the scope of the analysis. It was decided that in order to maintain “other thing equal” according to a well-known Latin phrase “ceteris paribus” only one online journal – The R Journal – was taken into account. Being equipped with a tool for faster reproduction of articles – the CodeExtractoR package – the authors agreed to examine about 20 articles that were published across a few years. Such a great number of papers meant that the approach taken could be described as holistic. It is also worth mentioning that usually 30 articles from each year were analyzed (at least whenever it was possible). Finally, it should be noted that in the case of the date when they were published the examined articles range from 2009 up to 2019. The third and final issue that should be considered in this part of the article focuses on the measures undertaken by the authors in order to tackle the problem of biased assessment. Although the scale that was proposed was not totally dependent on the person who was using it, it still left someplace for personal liking and disliking of the paper. As a way of marginalization of this trend the authors have taken part in many conversations when the facts that led to specific grading of the articles were shared. This enabled awarding the grades even more fairly. However, the final measure was much more simple and it was believed to be much more effective as well when compared to the previous one. The articles for each year were divided into 3 groups and assigned to one author each. Thus each author has examined the papers from the whole range of release dates that were taken into account. 1.3.4 Results Specific results are presented in Table 1.1, which shows the number of examined articles from 2009 up to 2019, grouped by received grade. The column “Grade” represents the 0 - III scale of reproducibility. The rest of the columns shows a number of papers that achieved a particular grade in each year. Grade 09’ 10’ 11’ 12’ 13’ 14’ 15’ 16’ 17’ 18’ 19’ 0 3 2 6 4 6 8 5 9 5 9 9 I 4 2 0 2 3 6 6 10 3 2 2 II 3 7 8 4 13 6 10 7 14 6 6 III 6 7 6 5 8 10 9 4 8 13 13 SUM 16 18 20 15 30 30 30 30 30 30 30 To better illustrate obtained data, in Figure 1.1 we have split the results into two groups - the articles which have 0 or I class labeled as “Non-reproducible” and articles with grade II and III as “Reproducible”. It is important to remember that from 2009 to 2012, the overall number of papers oscillated around 18 per year. After 2013, the number of researched articles was constant. FIGURE 1.1: Number of papers by publication year Figure 1.2 shows the results in the original 4-level scale. Although, the number of papers varies throughout the years in every reproducibility class, it is observable that intermediate ones - I and II, are less common in the oldest and newest papers. In addition, results in 2018 and 2019 are identical. FIGURE 1.2: Number of papers by class and publication year After calculating the percentage of each class in a specific year ( Figure 1.3, Figure 1.4), it is observed, that in the two oldest examined years - 2009 and 2010 - a ratio of completely unreproducible papers (with 0 or I class ) is surprisingly low. Furthermore, papers with III class of reproducibility are nearly 40% of all articles in these years. FIGURE 1.3: Ratio of each class throughout years Except for 2019, 2018 and 2016, percentage of fully reproducible papers (III class) is stable. In the newest articles, this percentage is slightly higher. Year 2016 is the only one, where unreproducible papers were in the majority. Only in 3 cases, percentage of reproducible articles dropped below 60%. FIGURE 1.4: Summarized results throughout years 1.3.5 Conclusions 1.3.6 Summary 1.4 Ways to reproduce articles in terms of release date and magazine Authors: Mikołaj Malec, Maciej Paczóski, Bartosz Rożek 1.4.1 Abstract 1.4.2 Introduction and Motivation Reproducibility is a topic which is quite diminished in today’s science world. Scientific articles should be current as long as possible. Their results should be achievable by reader and be the same. Thanks to that science and business world can take advantage of them.The more article is difficult to reproduce, the chance of using knowledge coming from it is smaller. Many researchers tried to define or give principles for reproducibility. There is article published in 2016: “What does research reproducibility mean?” (Goodman, Fanelli, and Ioannidis 2016b) which tried to warn about reproducibility crisis. Article in 2017: “Computational reproducibility in archaeological research: basic principles and a case study of their implementation” (Marwick 2016), compered computational reproducibility to archaeological research and give guidelines for researches to use reproducibility in computing research. But these are just two of many articles about reproducibility. Some articles are about tools and techniques for computational reproducibility (Piccolo and Frampton 2016). They encourage researchers to compute data using environments like Jupiter (Thomas et al. 2016) or R markdown (Marwick, Boettiger, and Mullen 2017). Thanks to that readers can reproduce finding on their own. What’s new about our approach to the subject of reproducibility is focusing on how can release date and magazine affect the amount of work needed to fully reproduce code or is it even possible. A comprehensive comparison of scientific magazines in terms of reproducibility is yet to be created and this article is our best effort to make it happen. Mikołaj Malec 1.4.3 Related Work 1.4.4 Methodology 1.4.5 Results 1.4.6 Summary and conclusions 1.5 Reproducibility of outdated articles about up-to-date R packages Authors: Zuzanna Mróz, Aleksander Podsiad, Michał Wdowski (Warsaw University of Technology) 1.5.1 Abstract 1.5.2 Introduction and Motivation The problem of the inability to reproduce the results of research presented in a scientific article may result from a number of reasons - at each stage of design, implementation, analysis and description of research results we must remember the problem of reproducibility - without sufficient attention paid to it, there is no chance to ensure the possibility of reproducing the results obtained by one team at a later time and by other people who often do not have full knowledge of the scope presented in the article. Reproducibility is a problem in both business and science. Science, because it allows credibility of research results (McNutt 2014). Business, because we care about the correct operation of technology in any environment (Anda, Sjøberg, and Mockus 2009). As cited from “What does research reproducibility mean?” (Goodman, Fanelli, and Ioannidis 2016b); “Although the importance of multiple studies corroborating a given result is acknowledged in virtually all of the sciences, the modern use of “reproducible research” was originally applied not to corroboration, but to transparency, with application in the computational sciences. Computer scientist Jon Claerbout coined the term and associated it with a software platform and set of procedures that permit the reader of a paper to see the entire processing trail from the raw data and code to figures and tables. This concept has been carried forward into many data-intensive domains, including epidemiology, computational biology, economics, and clinical trials. According to a U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) subcommittee on replicability in science, “reproducibility refers to the ability of a researcher to duplicate the results of a prior study using the same materials as were used by the original investigator. That is, a second researcher might use the same raw data to build the same analysis files and implement the same statistical analysis in an attempt to yield the same results…. Reproducibility is a minimum necessary condition for a finding to be believable and informative.” 1.5.3 Related Work Other notable articles about reproducibility include “Variability and Reproducibility in Software Engineering: A Study of Four Companies that Developed the Same System” (Anda, Sjøberg, and Mockus 2009), “Reproducible Research in Computational Science” (Peng 2011) and “A statistical definition for reproducibility and replicability” (Patil, Peng, and Leek 2016). “Variability and Reproducibility in Software Engineering: A Study of Four Companies that Developed the Same System” focuses on the variability and reproducibility of the outcome of complete software development projects that were carried out by professional developers. “Reproducible Research in Computational Science” is about limitations in our ability to evaluate published findings and how reproducibility has the potential to serve as a minimum standard for judging scientific claims when full independent replication of a study is not possible. “A statistical definition for reproducibility and replicability” provides formal and informal definitions of scientific studies, reproducibility, and replicability that can be used to clarify discussions around these concepts in the scientific and popular press. In our article we focus on the reproduction of old scientific articles on R and packages, which are still being developed. We want to explore how the passage of time affects the ability to reproduce results using the currently available updated tools. We are therefore testing backward compatibility for different packages and checking what affects the reproducibility of the code. We were unable to find scientific articles on this exact issue. There are articles that give ways to measure reproducibility, as well as articles about packages that help with reproduction. But there are yet no articles that summarize the set of packages in terms of their reproducibility. 1.5.4 Methodology We have checked 13 articles with 16 R packages from at least 10 years ago to ensure that the code chunks match these categories: ade4: Implementing the Duality Diagram for Ecologists (Dray and Dufour 2007) untb: an R Package For Simulating Ecological Drift Under the Unified Neutral Theory of Biodiversity (Hankin 2007) bio.infer: Maximum Likelihood Method for Predicting Environmental Conditions from Assemblage Composition (Yuan 2007) pls: principal Component and Partial Least Squares Regression in R (Mevik and Wehrens 2007) EMD: Empirical Mode Decomposition and Hilbert Spectrum (Kim and Oh 2009) AdMit: Adaptive Mixtures of Student-t Distributions (Ardia, Hoogerheide, and Dijk 2009) asympTest: A Simple R Package for Classical Parametric Statistical Tests and Confidence Intervals in Large Samples (Coeurjolly et al. 2009) PMML: An Open Standard for Sharing Models (Guazzelli et al. 2009) neuralnet: Training of Neural Networks (Günther and Fritsch 2010) mvtnorm: New Numerical Algorithm for Multivariate Normal Probabilities (Mi, Miwa, and Hothorn 2009) tmvtnorm: A Package for the TruncatedMultivariate Normal Distribution (Wilhelm and Manjunath 2010) party: A New, Conditional Variable-Importance Measure for Random Forests Available in the party Package (Strobl, Hothorn, and Zeileis 2009) deSolve, bvpSolve, ReacTran and RootSolve: R packages introducing methods of solving differential equations in R (Soetaert, Petzoldt, and Setzer 2010) In our research on the subject we have decided to divide the code from the articles into chunks, according to the principle that each chunk has its own output, to which we give an evaluation according to the criteria we have set. In the process of testing and reproducing various articles, we have identified five categories, and marked them as follows: NO REP (no reproducibility, either due to changes through time or problems with the article that had already been there, regardless of differences in R across years), HAD TO CHANGE STH (when we had to modify the code to produce correct results that will work in our current R version and can be neatly displayed in a document generated by markdown), MOSTLY REP (when the results were not ideally identical to the original, but in our opinion the chunks were working according to their purpose in the context of their article), HAD TO CHANGE &amp; STILL SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT (the code had to be changed and the results were not perfect, but they were correct in the terms of the aforementioned category “MOSTLY REP”, but we could consider them as satisfactory), FULLY REP (no reproductive problems - the results were identical to original results shown in the article). These criteria can be considered not subjective, but setting such boundaries does not cause confusion in categorisation, thus we decided to use them in order to research and describe the introduced number of articles about R packages from at least 10 years ago. 1.5.5 Results Here can be seen the in-depth report. Below are the summarised results of our research. TABLE 1.1: Chunk classifications NAZWA NOREP CHANGE MOSTLY CH.SD FULLY SUM ade4 0 0 2 1 4 7 untb 7 0 2 0 12 21 bio.infer 0 3 5 0 6 14 pls 0 0 11 0 21 32 EMD 0 0 1 0 15 16 AdMit 0 1 3 0 2 6 asympTest 0 0 3 0 2 5 PMML 0 1 0 0 3 4 neuralnet 1 0 8 0 0 9 mvtnorm 0 1 0 0 0 1 tmvtnorm 0 0 0 0 6 6 party 0 0 2 0 0 2 deSolve 0 0 0 0 3 3 bvpSolve 1 0 1 0 1 3 ReacTran 0 0 0 0 1 1 RootSolve 0 0 1 0 5 6 SUM 9 6 39 1 82 137 As it can be seen, the vast majority of chunks are fully reproducible. Even if the chunk is not executed identically to the original one, in most cases it differs only slightly, and the package itself serves its purpose. 88.3% (121/137) of the chunks are executed perfectly or correctly (within our subjective category of being acceptably incorrect), while 93.4% (128/137) of the chunks are working well enough not to throw errors. In practice, only 6.6% (9/137) of chunks were completely irreproducible, which would seem surprising for more-than-a-decade-old articles. However, given that we have focused particularly on packages that are still being developed, this is quite a feasible result. This can be seen quite clearly by the percentage of the chunks that required minor changes or slightly differed from the results shown in the article - there were 33.6% (46/137), which is clearly a result of the updates or changes that occured in the ever evolving R environment. Of course during our research we stumbled upon numerous packages that have not been updated since years or that have even been deleted from CRAN repository, so they were not within our field of interest. Nonetheless, we would like to emphasize that the results should not suggest that one-decade-old articles are reproducible. In some of the articles we found specific types of problems: There was no access to data or objects referred to in later calculations, The results were similar to the original, but the differences were most often due to the random generation of objects. This error was usually reduced later, when the package created some kind of data summary - then the result had a very small relative error with the original result. The names of individual variables or some of their attributes changed (e.g. column names in the data frame). 1.5.6 Summary and conclusions To sum up, in most cases the packages we examined performed their tasks correctly. The packages themselves have of course changed, but its idea remained the same. Usually new features or improvements were added, but the idea behind the package was the same as it used to be. As a result, most of the packages still managed to cope with the problems of the old ones, in reproduction usually suffering from missing external data or unavoidable changes in the R language itself. All in all, almost in all cases the package does the job in spirit, differing from its old good ways only in vague confusion caused by neverending winds of change. It can therefore be concluded that most packages that we’ve checked are fully backward compatible, which is good programming practice. In order to increase the reproducibility of articles, this should definitely be taken care of. Additionally, authors should include supplements to their articles, that always help you understand and copy the code. 1.6 Correlation between reproducibility of components of research papers and their purpose Authors: Przemysław Chojecki, Kacper Staroń, Jakub Szypuła (Warsaw University of Technology) 1.6.1 Abstract 1.6.2 Introduction and Motivation It is common knowledge that reproducibility is a way for science to evolve. It is the heart of the scientific method to revisit pre-existing measurements and to try to reproduce its results. However, the term „reproducibility” itself, as well it is crucial to the scientific methodology, it can be also universal at the expense of unambiguousness and usability. For the purpose of this paper we will have recourse to the definition introduced by ACM: Reproducibility - The measurement can be obtained with stated precision by a different team, a different measuring system, in a different location on multiple trials. For computational experiments, this means that an independent group can obtain the same resultusing artefacts which they develop completely independently. This particular definition ilustrates perfectly how in the course of establishing the meaning of term „Reproducibility”, the level of importance of auxiliary measurements and settings of the experiment to the overall results is omitted. It is notably significant misconception especially in the experiments from the field of computional science, when reproducing or even maintaining precise operating conditions is usually impossible. In the following chapters we will attempt to perform an analysis of reproducibility of the papers submitted to the RJournal, regarding especially presumed objectives of enclosed auxilliary computations and artifacts (i. e. code chunks) in overarching structure of a given paper. 1.6.3 Related Work Although there are many research papers related to this article, the following three could be perceived as a “basis” for our study. 1. Daniel Mendez, Daniel Graziotin, Stefan Wagner, and Heidi Seibold provides a definition of reproducibility this article uses, and distinguishes it from replicability(Fern’andez et al. 2019). 2. Steven N. Goodman, Daniele Fanelli and John P. A. Ioannidis defines multiple interpretations of reproducibility. It further divides and classifies reproducibility, and provides a basis on how one can do it(Goodman, Fanelli, and Ioannidis 2016a). In their search the authors have not encountered other research papers that study the aspect of reproducibility this article focuses on. If said papers do not actually exist, then this article could provide insights on previously unexamined aspects of reproducibility. 1.6.4 Methodology 1.6.4.1 General approach The methodology presented in the following section is a direct consequence of how we approach scientific article as an experience devised by an author for the reader. Our focus is to determine, how author alter this experience by using code chunks instead of plain text. In other words, we ask a question “Why have the authors used the R code?” Assumption that execution of enclosed code is an integral part of said experience and by extension code chunks supposed to be reproducible for reader to percept the article as intended seems to be reasonable. However it may not be correct in every case. Let us consider a situation, where generated output is essential to the thesis stated in the article. If the code is irreproducible, the reader cannot believe the authors. It devastates their credibility. But what if a goal of the code was to illustrate general tendency in data and output is reproducible only to some degree? Then it may still fulfill its purpose in the article and the lack of full reproducibility does not intefere with experience for a reader. Following this thought process inevitably leads to new questions, f.e. is it possible for executable code to serve its purpose in article while being completely unreproducible? To explore this topic we decided to focus on objectives of code in scientific papers. We have decided that the most accurate and reliable way of finding the purposes of code chunks in scientific articles is by examples. That is why we have analyzed over \\(30\\) papers from The R Journal [https://journal.r-project.org]. We have gathered the code chunks into groups and considered a three degree of purpose: the whole article, the group of chunks, and the single chunk of code. We have prepared a list of possible purposes for every level and assign them to our examples. The whole list of purposes is explained in the next chapter. Then we have produced our measure of reproducibility, which is also detailed later. 1.6.4.2 Objectives Since this article is centred around objectives, our understanding of them is of utmost importance. That is why we divided them into three categories, further divided into classes. We described them in detail in the sections below. To limit our individual biases in assessing what the intended objective is, we referred to relevant paragraphs in the original research paper. It has to be noted, that an object (let it be an article, a group of chunks or a chunk) can have more than one objective. 1.6.4.2.1 Main Objectives Both code chunks by themselves and performed computations corresponding with them can provide wide variety of information. However we can identify and describe reasons why the programming language is present in general in a given paper. All code chunks serve together as a vital element supporting narration of the article and its objective usually can be identified with main objective of narration in article as a whole. We systematized main objectives and grouped them into the following general objectives: package overview - presenting general structure of specific package, providing example of aplications implemented functions and discussing its performance object construction - presenting process of constructing and developing virtual object introduction to subject - using performing code as a complement to educational resource concerning given topic method implementation - presenting in-depth process of developing solution and explaining it addressing an issue - presenting solution to specific scientific/computational problem error identification - recognising and presenting error in existing package, possibly submit alternative solution covering mentioned error 1.6.4.2.2 Intermediate Objectives Since code chunks in research papers seldom appear on their own, but rather are part of a larger group of chunks serving a certain purpose. For instance, let there be three chunks, named A, B, and C. Let A load data from an external source, B modifies the data and extract a subset of it, and let C generate a plot, based on the data obtained from the two previous chunks. While each chunk has its own distinct objective, together they have at least common one - in this example this is generating a plot. Plot generated by A, B and C can be used to compare between performance of various functions. These chunk group’s objectives we define as intermediate objectives. We systematized intermediate objectives and grouped them into the following general objectives: package usage - examples on how does an R package operate, how one can use functions provided by the package, in what manner output is generated etc. practical use - underscoring of the practical usage of code used in code chunks in that group. method comparison - comparison between functions and/or methods. For example, a microbenchmark between base R functions and functions from a presented package. generating output - generating an output, for example plots, .csv files, images etc. presenting specification - presentation on what package specification looks like. data preparation - preparation of data that may be used later in the paper. This includes both loading the data and modifying it. occurrence demonstration - demonstration of an occurrence described earlier in the article. introduction to analysis - introduction to analysing a certain topic and data related to it. possible error - description of a possible error one can encounter and how one can solve it. 1.6.4.2.3 Chunk Objectives Each chunk has a role - it serves one or more purposes, which we define as chunk objectives. We systematized chunk objectives and grouped them into the following general objectives: aesthethic example - an example showcasing how output generated by the code chunk looks like. functional example - an example of how functions showcased in the chunk work. instruction - an instruction on how one achieves desired effect using R code. instruction (package) - same as above, but using functions from the package introduced in the article containing the chunk. data preparation - preparation of data for the following chunks. data exploration - merging, subsetting, summarisation of data and other types of data manipulation used in order to explore data. foreign error - turning attention to an error in work done by other author(s). solving a problem - description of how one solves a given problem using R code. data modification - modifying data in order to achieve desired effect. presentation of results - presenting result of computation within the article. This can be done by specific summarising functions (e.g. summarise) or simply printing base R vectors. plot - plotting graphs in the article. generating files - generation of files, this includes graphical, text and other files. results processing - processing of results in order to improve their aesthethic value or to make them more readable. erroneous action - presenting code that does not run properly as an example of an action should be avoided. uncallable code - code that, in principle, is impossible to run. This includes pseudocode. comparison to foreign work - comparation of authors’ work (functions, methods etc.) with work of others, that achieves the same effect. This includes benchmark performance comparisons. empirical proof - validation of what is mathematically described in earlier sections. 1.6.4.3 Reproducibility The sole purpose of this paper is to explore interactions between purposes of code chunks usage and reproducibility aberrations. That requires a system of classification of reproducibility. We provide simple categorization of forms of reproducibility into the 6 types. This classification system shall serve as a tool for initial phase of our analysis, thus it is not directly involving purpose of discussed code at this stage. perfect reproducibility - code perform flawlessly and after initial configuration precise output is recreated margin of error - after initial configuration code provides output matching expectations within acceptable margin of error (f.e. difference in rounded decimals, default parameters of generated graphics) editorial correction - code requires minor corrections to be executable and viable due to editorial error or changes in naming conventions environment setup - code to execute properly requires major and time-consuming setup and environment changes or may be not able to provide expected results at all unreproducible - code undoubtedly cannot be reproduced (f.e. due to unavailable data, unavailable package, unsupported fatal error) -1. missing point of reference - article does not provide (or vaguely provides) expected performence and determining reproducilibity is impossible 1.6.4.4 Tables description For analysis purposes, we have put our work into tables. The one can see the small part of them here: 1.6.4.4.1 1.Table of articles Every row represents one article. Every article has a column of an individual number, a sum of lengths of chunks of code, and information about purposes of articles. 1.6.4.4.2 2.Table of groups Every row represents one group of chunks. Every group has a column of an individual number, a sum of lengths of chunks of code, and information about purposes of the group. 1.6.4.4.3 3.Table of chunks Every row represents one chunk. Every chunk has a column of an individual number, its length of code, its reproducibility, and information about purposes of code. 1.6.4.4.4 Length assessment To objectively determine a length of code we have decided to count it with such rules: * skip all empty and commented lines * skip assignments, unless it contains the execution of a function * skip executions of functions library and data * skip lines with only technical meaning, i.e. } 1.6.5 Results 1.6.6 Summary and conclusions 1.7 How active development affects reproducibility Authors: Ngoc Anh Nguyen, Piotr Piątyszek, Marcin Łukaszyk (Warsaw University of Technology) 1.7.1 Abstract 1.7.2 Introduction and Motivation The key quality in measuring the outcome of researches and experiments is whether results in a paper can be attained by a different research team, using the same methods. Results presented in scientific articles may sometimes seem revolutionary, but there is very little use if it was just a single case impossible to reproduce. The closeness of agreement among repeated measurements of a variable made under the same operating conditions by different people, or over a period of time is what researches must bear in mind. Peng (2011) leading author of the commentary and an advocate for making research reproducible by others, insists reproducibility should be a minimal standard. There have been several reproducibility definitions proposed during the last decades. Gentleman and Temple Lang (2007) suggest that by reproducible research, we mean research papers with accompanying software tools that allow the reader to directly reproduce the results and employ the computational methods that are presented in the research paper. The second definition is according to Vandewalle, Kovacevic, and Vetterli (2009), research work is called reproducible if all information relevant to the work, including, but not limited to, text, data, and code, is made available, such that an independent researcher can reproduce the results. As said by LeVeque (2009) the idea of ‘reproducible research’ in scientific computing is to archive and make publicly available all the codes used to create a paper’s figures or tables, preferably in such a manner that readers can download the codes and run them to reproduce the results. All definitions converge into one consistent postulate - the data and code should be made available for others to view and use. The availability of all information related to research paper gives other investigators the opportunity to verify previously published findings, conduct alternative analyses of the same data, eliminate uninformed criticisms and most importantly - expedite the exchange of information among scientists. Reproducibility has great importance not only in the academic world but also it also plays a significant role in the business. The concept of technological dept is often used to describe the implied cost of additional rework caused by choosing an easy solution now instead of using a better approach that would take longer in software development. There are papers about using version control systems to provide reproducible results (Stanisic, Legrand, and Danjean 2015). The authors presented how we can manage to maintain our goal of reproducibility using Git and Org-Mode. Other researchers have created a software package that is designed to create reproducible data analysis (Fomel et al. 2013). They have created a package that contains computational modules, data processing scripts, and research papers. The package is build using the Unix principle to write programs that are simple and do well one thing. The program breaks big data analysis chains into small steps to ensure that everything is going in the right way. Some papers suggest using Docker to make sure our research can be reproduced (Hung et al. 2016). The main goal of our work is to measure the impact of the active development of packages on the reproducibility of scientific papers. Multiple authors (Rosenberg et al. 2020; Kitzes, Turek, and Deniz 2017) suggest using the version control system as a key feature in creating reproducible research. The second paper also provides evidence, that this is widely known. Git and GitHub were used in over 80% of cases. However, there are two kinds of using a version control system. An author can push software into the repository, to make it easily accessible and does not update it anymore. The second option is to keep the repository up-to-date and resolve users’ issues. We have not found any research on how these two approaches impact reproducibility. 1.7.3 Methodology Articles In our analysis, of reproducibility, we focused on articles introducing packages, that are actively developed on GitHub. Then we measure the reproducibility of an article using two versions of the package: current and the first after publication date to get the answer on the question, what if a package was never updated. In some cases, when it seems appropriate we used the last before publication. We selected 18 articles that were posted on R journal, that are on cran, are developed on GitHub, have code included to reproducibility, and doesn’t have too much impact on R environment. Measures of reproducibility We measured how many examples aren’t reproducible using these two versions. We categorized articles into 3 types of reproducibility: 1. The article is reproducible, minor differences can happen (e.g. different formating). 2. There are differences in function names, other packages that the article uses don’t work but at least half of it works. 3. Everything that doesn’t match 1 or 2. It means that the article is not reproducible. We have counted the three most common issues in each article: 1. Names - function or variable name has to be changed 2. API - way of using a function or their arguments has changed 3. Result - output differs Using these we can compare specific issues in the current and old versions of the package. Auxiliary variables To measure how a package is developed, we used several auxiliary variables from GitHub and CRAN: number of stars number of subscribers number of contributors number of issues number of open issues added and deleted lines since the publication date commits number since the publication date using Continuous Integration versions on CRAN since the publication date 1.7.4 Results Tested packages TABLE 1.2: Tested packages with measured reproducibility package old.version old.reproducibility new.reproducibility old.names.issues new.names.issues old.api.issues new.api.issues old.result.issues new.result.issues VSURF 1.0.2 2 2 4 0 2 1 3 4 MVN 3.8 1 3 0 0 0 7 0 0 mldr 0.2.51 2 2 1 1 0 0 0 0 fanplot 3.4.1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 Peptides 1.0.4 2 2 0 5 0 0 0 0 cmvnorm 1.0-3 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 factorplot 1.1 1 1 0 0 0 0 3 3 FactoMineR 1.3 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 gridGraphics 0.1-5 1 3 0 0 0 0 1 3 phaseR 1.3 1 2 0 3 0 0 0 0 betategarch 3 1 1 0 0 0 0 6 6 tempdisagg 0.22 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 mvtnorm 0.9-7 2 2 0 0 1 1 0 0 brainR 1.2 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 qmethod 1.3.0 2 2 0 0 0 0 1 1 stringdist 0.7.2 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 rotations 1.3 3 3 0 0 0 0 3 3 ggmap 2.3 3 3 0 1 0 9 13 2 Reproducibility scale As shown in table below, most packages have same reproducibility scale in each version. Some are less reproducible in current version than in the old. old.reproducibility new.reproducibility n 1 1 8 1 2 1 1 3 2 2 2 5 3 3 2 Issues count We compared if new versions of packages have more or less issues of each type than the old ones. Only for few articles these counts differ, but this data suggests negative impact of active development on reproducibility. Correlations with auxiliary variables This heatmap shows the correlation between reproducibility scale and issue count increase (new-old) with auxiliary variables. The reproducibility scale does not seem to be correlated with any of them. But there is a strong correlation between name issues count and number of lines added and removed since the publication date. Variables associated with popularity could impact on API changes. There are correlations with results, but results should not be analyzed alone, because when API issue occurs, then we cannot check results. 1.7.5 Summary and conclusions 1.8 Reproducibility differences of articles published in various journals and using R or Python language Authors: Bartłomiej Eljasiak, Konrad Komisarczyk, Mariusz Słapek (Warsaw University of Technology) 1.8.1 Abstract 1.8.2 Introduction and Motivation Due to the growing number of research publications and open-source solutions, the importance of repeatability and reproducibility is increasing. Although reproducibility is a cornerstone of science, a large amount of published research results cannot be reproduced (Gundersen and Kjensmo 2018). Repeatability and reproducibility are closely related to science. “Reproducibility of a method/test can be defined as the closeness of the agreement between independent results obtained with the same method on the identical subject(s) (or object, or test material) but under different conditions (different observers, laboratories etc.). (…) On the other hand, repeatability denotes the closeness of the agreement between independent results obtained with the same method on the identical subject(s) (or object or test material), under the same conditions.”(Slezak and Waczulikova 2011) Reproducibility is crucial since it is what an researcher can guarantee about a research. This not only ensures that the results are correct, but rather ensures transparency and gives scientists confidence in understanding exactly what was done (Eisner 2018). It allows science to progress by building on previous work. What is more, it is necessary to prevent scientific misconduct. The increasing number of cases is causing a crisis of confidence in science (Drummond 2012). In psychology the problem has already been addressed. From 2011 to 2015 over two hundred scientists cooperated to reproduce results of one hundred psychological studies (Anderson et al. 2019). In computer science (and data science) scientists notice the need for creating tools and guidelines, which help to guarantee reproducibility of solutions (Biecek and Kosinski 2017, @Stodden1240). There exist already developed solutions which are tested to be applied (Elmenreich et al. 2018). Reproducibility can focus on different aspects of the publication, including code, results of analysis and data collection methods. This work will focus mainly on the code - results produced by evaluation of different functions and chunks of code from analysed publications. In this paper we want to compare journals on the reproducibility of their articles. Moreover, we will present the reproducibility differences between R and Python - two of the most popular programming languages in data science publications.There is discussion between proponents of these two languages, which one is more convenient to use in data science. Different journals also compete between each other. There are already many metrics devised to assess which journal is better regarding this metric (Elsevier, n.d.). There are no publications related to the reproducibility topic which compare different journals and languages. Although there are some exploring reproducibility within one specific journal (Stodden, Seiler, and Ma 2018). What is more, journals notice the importance of this subject (McNutt 2014). Also according to scientists journals should take some responsibility for this subject (Eisner 2018). 1.8.3 Methodology We decided to focus on three journals: The Journal of Statistical Software The Journal of Machine Learning Research The Journal of Open Source Software The Journal of Statistical Software and The Journal of Machine Learning Research are well known among scientists in the field of data science. The Journal of Open Source Software is relatively new, was established in 2016. We choose articles randomly from the time frame 2015-present. From every journal we choose 10 articles, of which 5 are articles introducing an R package and 5 are introducing a Python library. We choose only articles having tests on their github repositories. For our metrics we test the following: Tests on github provided by authors - for R packages test_that tests, for Python libraries pytest and unittest tests. Examples from the article - we test whether chunks of code included in the article produce the same results. Number of examples in an article varies a lot, in particular all the articles from Journal of Open Source Software do not have any examples. Examples provided by the authors on github repository in the catalog examples. 1.8.3.1 How to compare articles? 1.8.3.1.1 Insight to the problem Before anything can be said about the differences in journals and languages, first there has to be a measure in which they can be compared. Journals in general prefer articles of the same structure. What it means is that articles from different journals can vary substantially. This includes not only topics but number of pages, style of writing and most importantly for the topic of this article the way they present code. Thus it comes as no surprise that there are many means how the code can be reproduced. Every so often when an article is presenting a package there can be no examples and only unit tests. Naturally, the opposite can occur. Obvious conclusion is that the proposed measure must not be in favor of any way of presenting code in the given article. The problem of defining the right measure of article reproducibility deserves a separate article itself and It should be stated that metrics used by us are for sure not without a flaw. We do not assume that they are unbiased but that they are true enough that we can draw conclusions from them. 1.8.3.1.2 Proposed metrics First of all, we did all tests provided by the author in the article or located on an online repository. But if there was an example but there was no direct connection to if from the article it was not included in our reproduction process, because in our opinion it’s not a part of the article and therefore journal. Because of what has been said in the previous paragraph we decided to look at articles from two perspectives. One is more bias, second is true to the sheer number of reproducible examples and positive tests. 1.8.3.1.3 Student’s Mark Analysis of the problem has led to the decision that numerical assessment of article reproducibility has too many flaws and does not represent well the problems that occur while recreating the results of an article. What we propose is a 4-degree mark ranging from 2 to 5. The highest mark, 5 is given if the author provided all results to the code shown in the article and repository and if the results can be fully reproduced. The article is scored 4 when there are some minor problems in the reproducibility of the code. For example, an article may lack the outputs to some part of the code shown or there are some errors in tests. The major rule is that code should still do what it was meant to do. If some errors happen, but they are not affecting the results, they are negligible. The article is scored 3 in a few cases. If an article lacks all or the vast majority of code outputs, but when reproduced it still produces reasonable results. When in some tests or examples we can observe non-negligible differences, but this cannot happen to a key element of the article. For example, the method proposed in the article describing training machine learning model works and the model is trained well, but there are errors in the part of the code where the model is used by some different library. If we would have to score the article based only on this example we would give it a 3. The article is scored 2 if there are visible differences in reproducing results of key elements of the article. Or If the code from the article didn’t work even though we had all dependencies. 1.8.3.1.4 Reproducibility value Second metric we used to analyse articles is simple and puts the same weight to the reproducibility problems of the tests and examples. \\[ R_{val} = 1 - \\frac{negative \\ tests + negative \\ examples}{all \\ tests + all \\ examples} \\] So a score of 0 represents an article that failed in all tests and had only not working examples. 1.8.4 Results Results of reproducing all chosen articles are presented in the following table: Title Journal Language Student’s Mark Reproducibility Value Autorank: A Python package for automated ranking of classifiers JOSS Python 4 0.95 PyEscape: A narrow escape problem simulator packagefor Python JOSS Python 2 0.8 Seglearn: A Python Package for Learning Sequences and Time Series JMLR Python 4 0.88 OpenEnsembles: A Python Resource for Ensemble Clustering JMLR Python 2 0.78 py-pde: A Python package for solving partial differential equations JOSS Python 2 0.86 PypeR, A Python Package for Using R in Python JSTAT Python 3 1 iml: An R package for Interpretable Machine Learning JOSS R 5 1 pyParticleEst: A Python Framework for Particle-Based Estimation Methods JSTAT Python 3 0.67 mimosa: A Modern Graphical User Interface for 2-level Mixed Models JOSS R 3 0.67 TensorLy: Tensor Learning in Python JMLR Python 3 1 The flare Package for High Dimensional Linear Regression and Precision Matrix Estimation in R JMLR R 3 1 The huge Package for High-dimensional Undirected Graph Estimation in R JMLR R 3 1 mlr: Machine Learning in R JMLR R 4 0.98 origami: A Generalized Framework for Cross-Validation in R JOSS R 5 1 learningCurve: An implementation of Crawford’s and Wright’s learning curve production functions JOSS R 5 1 tacmagic: Positron emission tomography analysis in R JOSS R 5 1 frailtyEM: An R Package for Estimating Semiparametric Shared Frailty Models JSTAT R 4 0.79 Beyond Tandem Analysis: Joint Dimension Reduction and Clustering in R JSTAT R 5 1 rmcfs: An R Package for Monte Carlo Feature Selection and Interdependency Discovery JSTAT R 2 0.57 Pyglmnet: Python implementation of elastic-net regularized generalized linear models JOSS Python 5 0.98 corr2D: Implementation of Two-Dimensional Correlation Analysis in R JSTAT R 4 1 RLPy: A Value-Function-Based Reinforcement Learning Framework for Education and Research JMLR Python 2 0.59 Rclean: A Tool for Writing Cleaner, More Transparent Code JOSS R 5 1 Graph Transliterator: A graph-based transliteration tool JOSS Python 4 0.93 CoClust: A Python Package for Co-Clustering JSTAT Python 2 0.3 To better present obtained results plots below show distribution of marks within each journal and language: (#fig:plot_mark_journals_stacked)Distribution of ‘Student’s Mark’ score of reproduced articles within each journal.

Meeting black box model performance levels. Authors: Karol Saputa, Małgorzata Wachulec, Aleksandra Wichrowska (Warsaw University of Technology) 3.1.1 Abstract 3.1.2 Introduction and Motivation In the classification problems, the main goal is to map inputs to a categorical target variable. Most machine learning algorithms assume that the class attribute is unordered. However, there are many problems where target variable is ranked, for example while predicting movie ratings. When applying standard methods to such problems, we lose some informaton, which could improve our model performance. This paper presents various methods to make an explainable machine learning model for ordinal classification problem. The aim is to achieve better results than ‘black box’ model does. We will test some existing approaches to ordinal classification and take advantage of analysis and imputation of missing data, feature transformation and selection, as well as knowledge from exploratory data analysis. Our experiments are based on ‘eucalyptus’ dataset from OpenML. The dataset’s objective is to find the best seedlot for soil conservation in seasonally dry hill country. Predictions are made depending on features such as height, diameter and survival of the plants. Target variable is ordered - it is represented by values ‘low’, ‘average’, ‘good’ and ‘best’. 3.1.3 Related Work 3.1.3.1 An approach to ordinal classification 3.1.3.1.1 Ordinal classification as a regression task As described in [2], one of the most fundamental techniques is to cast target labels to a sequence of numbers. Then, a standard regression can be applied. There is an additional information about the classes in comparison to usual nominal classification. Also a metric used is different than in a classification task - mean square error used in a regression task takes into account similarities between two labels when conversion is applied. 3.1.3.1.2 Transformation to multiple binary classification problems 3.1.3.2 Comparing black box to linear model 3.1.4 Methodology 3.1.4.1 Initial preprocessing The aim of this article was to build the best interpretable model for an ordinal classification problem and comparing it to a black box model. First undertaken step was dividing the data into training and test sets, consisting of 70% and 30% of all data, respectively. Since the considered dataset has a categorical target variable, the division was done using random sampling within each class of the target variable in an attempt to balance the class distributions within the splits. A seed was used to assure the same split in each tested model. In order to get a legitimate comparison, the data was initially preprocessed in such a way as to assure that both models’ performances are compared on the same test set. This initial preprocessing included: deleting the observations with ‘none’ value in the target variable from both the training set and the test set; deleting observations with missing values from test set, resulting in a 6% decease of the test set observations. It is important to note that missing values are still present in the training set. The reason why the missing data is deleted from the test set is that many of the explainable models cannot be run with missing data present. This means that the missing values will have to either be deleted or imputed later on. This leads to a possibility that the explainable model will impute missing data differently than the black box model, resulting in two different tests sets. And, if - instead of imputing missing data - we decide to delete it in order to make running explainable model possible, then the obtained test sets will differ in number of rows, making it impossible to draw any meaningful conclusions. Hence the missing data were deleted from the test set. 3.1.4.2 Running the black box model The black box model chosen for comparison is an extreme gradient boosting model. After the initial preprocessing the xgboost model was trained on the training set and used to predict results on the test set. As this model can only deal with numerical data, categorical (factor) variables were transformed using one hot encoding. The training proces and prediction were done using the mlr package in R, and the exact model specifications were the following: Learner classif.xgboost from package xgboost Type: classif Name: eXtreme Gradient Boosting; Short name: xgboost Class: classif.xgboost Properties: twoclass,multiclass,numerics,prob,weights,missings,featimp Predict-Type: response Hyperparameters: nrounds=200,verbose=0,objective=multi:softmax The quality of prediction was measured using the AUC (area under ROC curve) measure. This provides the base for this research, to which other models’ results will be compared to. 3.1.4.3 Running the basic version the explainable model We have chosen a tree model to be the considered explainable model, its exact specifications were the following: Learner classif.rpart from package rpart Type: classif Name: Decision Tree; Short name: rpart Class: classif.rpart Properties: twoclass,multiclass,missings,numerics,factors,ordered,prob,weights,featimp Predict-Type: response Hyperparameters: xval=0 As this model cannot be run with missing data, they were deleted from the training set before training the model. Another step was deleting one from each of the one-hot-encoded variables (the default function transforms variable with n factor levels into n columns, but n-1 columns are sufficient as the n-th column is a linear combination of the remaining n-1 columns). This model performed worse than the black box model - the outcomes are presented in the Results section of this article. 3.1.4.4 Improving the explainable model As mentioned before, the explainable model was enhanced by applying existing approaches to ordinal classification, feature transformation and selection and missing data imputation. The refinement process consisted of, but was not limited to, the following: Splitting a multiclass classification problem into 3 binary classification problems, like explained in the An approach to ordinal classification section of this article, and using the rpart model on each of the binary problems. Changing the levels of the target variable:“low”, “average”, “good”, “best” into numeric values: 1, 2, 3, 4, respectively and running a regression rpart model. Imputing missing data in the training set. Selecting variables: deleting the site names and specific location tags. Transforming Latitude variable from factor to numeric. The fourth step has a scientific justification. The experiment for which the data was collected was focused on finding the best seedlot for soil conservation in seasonally dry hill country. All the data in this dataset comes from New Zealand, but there is a chance that the results of such experiment would be used for other geographical regions. So far our model was making the prediction based also on specific flat map coordinates and site names, that are present both in the training and the test set. This means it would be impossible to use this model for judging seedlots of eucalypti planted outside of New Zealand. To make this possible, we have decided to take away all the variables that give away the exact position of the seedlots, leaving features such as latitude and the characteristics of plants and their habitat. After each improvement the model was retrained and the results obtained on the test set were saved and compared with the previous version of the model. If the new change has improved the model’s performance on the test set then it became the base for further development. Instead, if it has not improved the model’s performance, the previous version of the model was being further developed. 3.1.5 Results Explainable models: Model AUC MSE ACC ACC1 Percent Best AUC Basic rpart 0.8259145 0.5284076 0.5835207 0.9797400 95,89% Three binary rparts 0.8430115 0.5392606 0.5816277 0.9826626 97,88% Regression rpart 0.86115629 0.4994688 0.5814851 0.93207583 99,99% Regression rpart with imputation 0.8597930 0.5038168 0.5798347 0.9306883 99,83% Regression rpart with no location 0.8612852 0.4995913 0.5815428 0.9323226 100,00% Regression rpart with no location and numeric lattitide 0.8612474 0.4993377 0.5816065 0.9322628 100,00% Black box models: Model AUC MSE ACC ACC1 Percent Best AUC Xgboost 0.8589771 0.4466546 0.6247675 0.9873244 99.73% Xgboost with nrounds=5 0.8405102 0.4997935 0.6043936 0.9830193 97,59% 3.1.6 Model explanantion 3.1.7 Summary and conclusions 3.1.8 References Frank, Eibe &amp; Hall, Mark.

Authors: Wojciech Bogucki, Tomasz Makowski, Dominik Rafacz (Warsaw University of Technology) 3.2.1 Abstract 3.2.2 Introduction and Motivation Since the very beginning of the computer revolution there have been attempts to increase efficiency in determining possible defects and failures in the code. An effective method to do so could bring many potential benefits by identifying such sites as early as at the code development stage and eliminating costly errors at the deployment stage. McCabe and Halstead proposed a set of measures that are based on static properties of the code (including basic values, e.g. number of lines of code or number of unique operators, as well as transformations of them, (1976, @halstead77)). In their hypotheses, they argue that these measures can significantly help to build models that predict the sensitive spots in program modules. However, it can be argued that the measures they propose are artificial, non-intuitive, and above all, not necessarily authoritative, not taking into account many aspects of the written code and program (Fenton and Pfleeger 1997). To support their hypotheses with, McCabe and Halstead collected information about the code used in NASA using scrapers and then used machine learning algorithms. In this article we use the above data sets to build a model that best predicts the vulnerability of the code to errors. We check whether static code measures (being transformations of basic predictors) significantly improve prediction results for the so-called white box models (e.g. trees and linear regression). Our goal is to build, using simple data transformations and easily explainable methods, a so-called white box machine learning model (e.g. tree or logistic regression) that will achieve results comparable to the black box model (such as neural networks or gradient boosting machines) used on data without advanced measures. We also want to compare the effectiveness of the measures proposed by McCabe and Halstead and compare them with the measures we have generated. 3.2.3 Dataset Our dataset comes from the original research of Halstead and McCabe. We obtained it by combining the sets from OpenML (Vanschoren et al. 2013) and supplementing them with data from the PROMISE repository (Sayyad Shirabad and Menzies 2005). It contains data collected from NASA systems written in C and C++ languages. The data is in the form of a data frame containing more than 15000 records. Each record describes one “program module”. – with this generic term, the authors defined the simplest unit of functionality (in this case, these are functions). Each record is described with a set of predictors, which can be divided into several groups: Basic measures (such as number of lines of code, number of operands, etc.). McCabe’s measures how complex the code is in terms of control flow and cross-references . Halstead’s measures for general code readability. Target column (1 if module contains defects, 0 if not). Source column we added, specifying from which subsystem the module came (the original 5 datasets came from different systems). In order to verify our hypotheses, we decided at the beginning to remove the Halstead’s measures (which were transformations of the basic measures) from the collection to see if we are able to build an effective black box model without them. We also wanted to remove McCabe’s measurements, but the basic measurements that he used to calculate his measurements are not preserved in the collection, so we decided to keep them. There are not many records with openly missing data in the set (&lt; 1%), however, the values of some columns raise doubts – in the column containing information about the number of lines of code of a given module in many cases there is a value 0, which is not reliable. We consider 0 in this column to be missing data and remove records that have 0 here (almost 2000 records). 3.2.4 Methodology Our research consist of the following stages: Data exploration. Initial data preparation. Building of black-box and white-box models and comparing them against the relevant measurements. Repeating the cycle: Improvement of white box models by modifying their parameters or data. Measuring the effectiveness of the models built. Analysis of the resulting models. Keeping or rejecting changes for further work. Selection of the best white box model and final comparison with the black box model. We use R programming language and popular machine learning project management packages - mlr and drake (Bischl et al. 2016, @drake). 3.2.4.1 Data exploration At this stage, we are taking a closer look at what the data looks like and we are analyzing their distributions, gaps, correlations and simple relationships. 3.2.4.2 Initial data preparation This stage consists mainly of merging the data sets, as mentioned earlier, and adding a source column (in fact, we added five indicator columns, which contain one-hot-encoded value, as models generally do not cope well with character columns). Since there were very few data gaps, we are imputing them with the median, because this method is effective and fast. Imputation is necessary from the very beginning, as many models cannot cope with missing values. Since there were very few missing values, it does not affect significantly the result of those models that models that would still work. We are not carrying out further transformations at this stage because we do not want to disturb the results of the next stage. 3.2.4.3 Starting models We’re building models on this almost unaltered data. We are using one poorly interpretable model (black-box) – random forest, specifically ranger package (Wright and Ziegler 2017), because it is fast and low-effort. Among well interpretable models (white-boxes) used in our work there are: logistic regression, decision tree, k-nearest neighbors algorithm. We train the models into data that we have divided into five folds with a similar distribution of the decision variable, on which we will perform cross-validation. Then we compare the results using commonly used measure – AUC (Area Under Curve) (Flach, Hernandez-Orallo, and Ferri 2011), which not only assesses whether the observations are well classified, but also takes into account the likelihood of belonging to a class. We use AUC as the main comparative criterion of the models also in the further part of our work. 3.2.4.4 Improving white-boxes This is a key part of our work. In the iterative cycle we use different methods to improve the quality of the white box models. After applying each of these methods, we check whether it has improved our score and possibly analyze the model, using statistical methods (residuals analysis) and explanatory machine learning (DALEX package (Biecek 2018)), to draw indications of what should be done next. We are trying the following methods: Tuning hyperparameters of models – Default hyperparameters for models are generally good, but in specific cases using specific hyperparameters may yield in better results, so we use model-based optimization for tuning those parameters (Bischl et al. 2017). Logarithmic and exponential transformations of individual variables – So that linear relationships can be better captured and to reduce the influence of outliers, we transform variables using exponential and polynomial functions. Discretization of continuous features – Some variables do not have a linear effect on the response variable, even if they are transformed by simple functions like exponential function, sometimes there are clear thresholds – so we can replace the variable with indexes of individual segments. The SAFE algorithm helps with this (Gosiewska et al. 2019). Generating new columns as functions of other columns – There may be interactions between variables that cannot be captured by linear models. In order to take them into account, we generate new columns, applying to the rest of them various transformations – we take their inverses, products, quotients, elevations to power, and so on. As a result of these operations, a lot of new predictors are created, which we later evaluate. We also analyze their interpretability, i.e. to what extent they are translatable into an intuitive understanding of such a measure. At this point we also consider Halstead and McCabe’s measurements. Oversampling and undersampling – On the basis of the data set, we generate more observations from the minority class using the SMOTE algorithm (Hu and Li 2013) and remove some of the observations from the majority class so that the model more emphasizes the differences in characteristics of individual classes. Reducing outliers – For each variable a two-value vector that indicates the thresholds for which the values are considered as outliers is generated. Then all outliers are changed to the nearest value of obtained earlier vector. Our goal is to beat black-box model. In our case we chose random forest model from package ranger. As a white-box model we used logistic regression. Results were tested on dataset with different transformations.

Authors: Mateusz Bakala, Michal Pastuszka, Karol Pysiak (Warsaw University of Technology) 3.3.1 Abstract In this section we compare efficiency of explainable and black-box AI models in detection of the Higgs boson. Afterwards, we explore possible improvements to explainable models which might boost their accuracy to be on par with black-boxes, of which the most notable is R package called rSAFE. Lastly, we conclude that (((conclusion depends on results))). 3.3.2 Introduction and Motivation ‘We fear that, which we do not understand’. This principle has often been used to portray artificial intelligence in popular culture. The notion that it is something beyond human comprehension became so common, that it started to affect the way we perceive computer algorithms. Because of that, it comes as no surprise that people become wary, hearing that the decisions which affect them directly were made by an AI. Machine Learning models, regardless of the algorithm used, are often treated as a black box that takes some data as an input and returns a prediction based on said data. This approach is most often seen from people who are unfamiliar with the methods used. In many fields, where the only concern is achieving results that are as accurate as possible, this is not a concern. There are however situations, where the risk of unpredictable or unjustified results is unacceptable. This includes uses in medical and judicial systems, where an incorrect decision may have severe consequences. Artificial intelligence could find plenty of uses in those areas, but it would require creating models, which make decisions based on a transparent set of rules. Those include algorithms such as decision trees and linear regression. That raises another problem. Such models often underperform in comparison to more advanced algorithms, notably artificial neural networks and ensemble based solutions, which are more capable at detecting nonlinearities and interactions in the data. Being able to achieve results comparable with said models, while retaining explainability would allow to increase the role of machine learning in fields where transparency is required. Furthermore, it would provide tools suitable for scientific analysis of relations between complex phenomena. The problem we study tackles methods of improving the predictions of simple models while retaining their transparency. In the rest of the paper we will describe methods of transforming the data to increase the quality of predictions. Most notably we will focus on a tool named rSAFE, which allows us to extract nonlinearities in the data, based on predictions of a so called ‘surrogate’ model. 3.3.3 Related Work https://arxiv.org/pdf/1402.4735.pdf – Searching for Exotic Particles in High-Energy Physics with Deep Learning 3.3.4 Methodology 3.3.4.1 Data Modern high energy physics is being done in colliders, of which the best known is Large Hadron Collider near Geneva. Here, basic particles are accelerated to collide at almost speed of light, resulting in creation of other, searched for particles. However, not every collision leads to desired processes and even then target particles may be highly unstable. One of such tasks is producing Higgs bosons by colliding two gluons. If a collision is successful, two gluons fuse into electrically-neutral Higgs boson, which then decays into a W boson and electrically-charged Higgs boson, which in turn decays into another W boson and the light Higgs boson. The last one decays mostly into two bottom quarks. However, if a collisions isn’t successful, two gluons create two top quarks, decaying then into a W boson and a bottom quark each, resulting in the same end-products, but without a Higgs boson in an intermediate state. The first process is called ‘signal’, while the second – ‘background’. Our dataset is a dataset called ‘higgs’, retrieved from OpenML database. It contains about 100 thousand rows of data generated with an event generator using Monte Carlo method and is a subset of a HIGGS dataset from UCI Machine Learning Repository. The purpose of this data is to be used as a basis for approximation of a likelihood function, which in turn is used to extract a subspace of high-dimensional experiment data where null hypothesis can be rejected, effectively leading to a discovery of a new particle. Each row describes event, which must satisfy a set of requirements. Namely, exactly one electron or muon must be detected, as well as no less than four jets, every of these with the momentum transverse to the beam direction of value \\(&gt; 20 GeV\\) and an absolute value of pseudorapidity less than \\(2.5\\). Also, at least two of the jets must have b-tag, meaning than they come from bottom quarks. Each event is described by its classification, 1 if a Higgs boson took part in the process or 0 if not. This column is our target, so it’s a two-class classification problem. There are 21 columns describing various low-level features, amongst which there are 16 describing momentum transverse to the beam direction (jetXpt), pseudorapidity (jetXeta), azimuthal angle (jetXphi) and presence of b-tag (jetXb-tag) for each of the four jets, as well as three first of these for the lepton (that is, electron or muon) and missing energy magnitude and its azimuthal angle. There are also 7 columns describing reconstructed invariant mass of particles appearing as non-final products of the collision event. Names like m_jlv or m_wbb mean that the mass reconstructed is of a particle which products consist of jet, lepton and neutrino or a W boson and two bottom quarks respectively. In this case, these particles are namely top quark and electrically-charged Higgs boson. These columns are so-called top-level features. 3.3.4.2 Measures The first measure that we will use is a simple accuracy. It can be misleading, especially when the target variable is unbalanced, but it is very intuitive and in our dataset the target variable is well-balanced. Second measure is the AUC score, which stands for Areas Under Curve of Receiver Operating Characteristic. It requires probabilities as an output of the model. We create the curve by moving the threshold of a minimal probability of a positive prediction from 0 to 1 and calculating the true positive rate to false positive rate ratio. This measure is much less prone to give falsely high scores than accuracy. The worst score in the AUC is \\(0.5\\). We want to get AUC score as close as possible to \\(1\\), however, close to \\(0\\) is not bad, we just must invert the labels and we will get a close to \\(1\\) AUC score. Our last measure is the Area Under the Precision Recall Curve (AUPRC). It is very similar to AUC score, we just use Precision and Recall measures instead of true and false positive rates. It is quite resistant to a bad balance of the target variable. We want to reach the score as close as possible to \\(1\\) and the score of \\(0\\) is the worst possible case. 3.3.4.3 Models The main goal of this research is to find a way of enhancing the performance of interpretable models, so now we will choose algorithms for this task. For the first test algorithm we chose the logistic regression. It is one of the simplest classification methods. Like in the linear regression algorithm we fit a function to the training data, just instead of a linear function we use a logistic function for the logistic regression algorithm. So the interpretability amounts to the understanding of how points are spread throughout the space. The second algorithm that we will use is a decision tree. It’s structure is very intuitive. We start our prediction from the root of a tree. Then we go up to the leaves basing our path on conditions stated in particular nodes. It is similar to how humans make their decisions. If we have to make one big decision we divide it into many smaller decisions which are much easier to make and after answering some yes/no questions we reach the final answer to the question, so to interpret this model we have to understand how these small decisions in every node are made. Black box models usually have very complex structure, which gives them advantage in recognising complex structures of the data. On the other hand, they are very hard to interpret and explain compared to white box models. There is a package in the R language named rSAFE that meets halfway between black box models and white box models. It is a kind of a hybrid that uses black box models for extracting new features from the data and then using them to fit interpretable models. We will use it for enhancing our interpretable model and compare them to pure white box models. To have some perspective of what level of quality of predictions we can reach we will test some black box models. The black box model that we will use is ranger. This is a fast implementation of random forests. This is a light and tunable model, so we will try to reach the best performance as we can with this algorithm. For easily comparable results we will use exactly the same training and testing dataset. However, we do not limit our feature engineering to only one process for all models, because every algorithm can perform better with different features than the rest. What is more, we will focus on augmenting data in a way that will enable us to get as much as we can from simple, interpretable models. 3.3.5 Results 3.3.6 Summary and conclusions 3.4 Can Automated Regression beat linear model? Authors: Bartłomiej Granat, Szymon Maksymiuk, (Warsaw University of Technology) 3.4.1 Abstract 3.4.2 Introduction and Motivation Health-related problems have been a topic of multiple papers throughout the years and machine learning brought some new methods to modern medicine. We care so much about our lives that every single algorithm and method eventually gets tested on some medical data. What is unique about health data is that black-box models are completely useless in this subject. Almost always doctors know whether a patient is sick or not. What is important to them is the reason why he is sick. That’s why explainable machine learning is the key to make all of us healthier. However, making a good explainable model for health data might be close to impossible. Medical problems of all kinds can be very unique, complex, or completely random. That’s why researchers spend numerous hours on improving their explainable models and that’s why we decided to test our approach on liver disorders dataset. The following dataset is well known in the field of machine learning and that’s exactly the reason why we chose it. It is described in the next chapter. Our goal was to find a relatively clean dataset with many models already done by other people. We don’t want to show that properly cleaned data gives better results but to achieve, an explainable model found after a complex analysis that we want to test. In this paper we do a case study on liver disorders dataset and want to prove that by using automated regression it is possible to build an easy to understand prediction that outperforms black-box models on the real dataset and at the same time achieve similar results to other researchers. 3.4.3 Data The dataset we use to test our hypothesis is a well-known liver-disorders first created by ‘BUPA Medical Research Ltd.’ containing a single male patient as a row. The data consists of 5 features which are the results of blood tests a physician might use to inform diagnosis. There is no ground truth in the data set relating to the presence or absence of a disorder. The target feature is attribute drinks, which are numerical. Some of the researchers tend to split the patients into 2 groups: 0 - patients that drink less than 3 half-pint equivalents of alcoholic beverages per day and 1 - patients that drink more or equal to 3 and focus on a classification problem. All of the features are numerical. The data is available for 345 patients and contains 0 missing values. The dataset consists of 7 attributes: mcv - mean corpuscular volume alkphos - alkaline phosphatase sgpt - alanine aminotransferase sgot - aspartate aminotransferase gammagt - gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase drinks - number of half-pint equivalents of alcoholic beverages drunk per day selector - field created by the BUPA researchers to split the data into train/test sets For further readings on the dataset and misunderstandings related to the selector column incorrectly treated as target refer to: “McDermott &amp; Forsyth 2016, Diagnosing a disorder in a classification benchmark, Pattern Recognition Letters, Volume 73.” 3.4.4 Methodology AutoMl Model \\(M_{aml}\\) and the dataset \\(D\\) that consists of \\(D_{X} = X\\) which is set of independent variables and \\(D_{y} = y\\) - dependent variable (ie. target). We assume that \\(M_{aml}\\) is an unknown function \\(M_{aml}: \\mathbb{R}^{p} \\to \\mathbb{R}\\), where p is a snumber of features in the \\(D\\) Dataset, that satisfies \\(y = M_{aml}(X) + \\epsilon\\) where \\(\\epsilon\\) is an error vector. Automated regression constructs known vector function \\(G_{AR} : \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times p} \\to \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times p}\\) where \\(n\\) is a number of observations, that satisfies \\(y = G_{AR}(X)\\beta + \\epsilon\\) thus it is linear regression model fitted for transformated data. To find \\(G_{AR}\\) we have to put some constraints. First of all we want it to minimize loss function \\(L: \\mathbb{R}^{n} \\to \\mathbb{R}\\) given by following formula \\(L : \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n}(y_{i}-\\hat{y_{i}})^{2}\\sum_{i=1}^{n}(y_{i}-\\bar{y_{i}})^{2}}{\\sum_{i=1}^{n}(\\hat{y_{i}}-\\bar{y_{i}})^{2}}\\) which can be interpreted as Mean Square Error divided by the R-squred coefficient of determination and stands as a tradeoff between fit and results. Another constraint is a domain of valid transformations of particular variables. For given dataset, described in the previous paragraphs we decided to use: Feature selection XAI feature Importance AIC/BIC Continuous transformation Polynomial transformation Lograthmic transformation Discrete transformation SAFE method Feature concatenation Multiplication of pair of features. Obviously, XAI related methods are conducted using AutoML Model. We’ve decided to omit data imputation as an element of valid transformations dataset because liver-disorders dataset does not meet with the problem of missing values. The optimization process is conducted based on Bayesian Optimization and the backtracing idea. Each main element of the domain of valid transformations is one step in the process of creation \\(G_{AR}\\) function. Within each step, Bayesian optimization will be used to find the best transformation for the given level. During further steps, if any of transformation did not improve model, ie. \\(L\\) function was only growing, the algorithm takes second, the third, etc. solution from previous steps according to backtracking idea. If for no one of \\(k\\) such iterations, where k is known parameter, a better solution is found, step is omitted. 3.4.5 Results 3.4.6 Summary and conclusions 3.5 Interpretable, non-linear feature engineering techniques for linear regression models - exploration on concrete compressive strength dataset with a new feature importance metric. Authors: Łukasz Brzozowski, Wojciech Kretowicz, Kacper Siemaszko (Warsaw University of Technology) 3.5.1 Abstract In this article we present and compare a number of interpretable, non-linear feature engineering techniques used to improve linear regression models performance on Cocrete compressive strength dataset. To assert their interpretability, we introduce a new metric for measuring feature importance, which uses derivatives of feature transformations to trace back original features’ impact. As a result, we obtain a thorough comparison of transformation techniques on two black-box models - Random Forest and Support Vector Machine - and three glass-box models - Decision Tree, Elastic Net, and linear regression - with the focus on the linear regression. 3.5.2 Introduction and Motivation Linear regression is one of the simplest and easiest to interpret of the predictive models. While it has already been thorougly analysed over the years, there remain some unsolved questions. One such question is how to transform the data features in order to maximize the model’s effectiveness in predicting the new data. An example of a known and widely used approach is the Box-Cox transformation of the target variable, which allows one to improve the model’s performance with minimal increase in computational complexity (Sakia 1992). However, the choice of the predictive features’ transformations is often left to intuition and trial-and-error approach. In the article, we wish to compare various methods of features’ transformations and compare the resulting models’ performances while also comparing their computational complexities and differences in feature importance. Many black box regression models use various kinds of feature engineering during the training process. Unfortunately, even though the models perform better than the interpretable ones, they do not provide information about the transformations used and non-linear dependencies between variables and the target. The goal we want to achieve is extracting features and non-linearities with understandable transformations of the training dataset. To measure the improvement of used methods we will compare their performance metrics with black box models’ as a ground truth. This will allow us to effectively measure which method brought the simple linear model closer to the black box. Moreover, we will take under consideration the improvement of black box model performance. Thanks to this, our article will not only present the methods for creating highly performant interpretable models, but also improvement of the results of black box model. 3.5.3 Related Work There exist many papers related to feature engineering. We will shortly present two of them. One of these papers is “Enhancing Regression Models for Complex Systems Using Evolutionary Techniques for Feature Engineering” Patricia Arroba, José L. Risco-Martín, Marina Zapater, José M. Moya &amp; José L. Ayala (Patricia Arroba 2015). This paper describes, how feature transformations in linear regression can be chosen based on the genetic algorithms. Another one is “Automatic feature engineering for regression models with machine learning: An evolutionary computation and statistics hybrid” Vinícius Veloso de Melo, Wolfgang Banzhaf (Melo] and Banzhaf 2018). Similarly to the previous one, this paper tries to automate feature engineering using evolutionar computation to make a hybrid model - final model is simple linear regression while its features are found by more complex algorithm. 3.5.4 Methodology The main goal of our research is to compare various methods of transforming the data in order to improve the linear regression’s performance. While we do not aim to derive an explicitly best solution to the problem, we wish to compare some known approaches and propose new ones, simultaneously verifying legitimacy of their usage. The second goal of the research is to compare the achieved models’ performances with black box models to generally compare their effectiveness. An important observation about the linear regression model is that once we transform features in order to improve the model’s performance, it strongly affects its interpretability. We therefore propose a new feature importance measure for linear regression and compare it with the usual methodes where possible. 3.5.4.1 Transformation methods The four methods of feature transformation compared in the article include: By-hand-transformations - through a trial-and-error approach we derive feature transformations that allow the linear regression models to yield better results. We use our expertise and experience with previous datasets to get possibly best transformations which are available though such process. They include taking the features to up to third power, taking logarithm, sinus, cosinus or square root of the features. Brute Force method - this method of data transformation generates huge amount of additional features being transformations of the existing features. We allow taking each feature up to the third power, taking sinus and cosinus of each feature and additionaly a product of each pair of features. The resulting dataset has \\(69\\) variables including the target (in comparison with \\(9\\) variables in the beginning). Bayesian Optimization method (Bernd Bischl 2018) - we treat the task of finding optimal data transformation as an optimization problem. We restrict the number of transformations and their type - we create one additional feature for each feature present in the dataset being its \\(x\\)-th power, where \\(x\\) is calculated through the process of Bayesian optimization. It allows us to keep the dimension of the dataset relatively small while improving the model’s performance. We allowed the exponents to be chosen from interval \\((1, 4]\\). One of our ideas is to use GP (Genetic Programming) to find best feature transformations. Our goal is to find simple feature transformations (not necessarily with arity 1) that will significantly boost oridnary linear regression. We will create a set of simple operations such as adding, multiplying, taking a specific power, for example 2, taking logarithm and so on. Each transformation is based only on these operations and specified input variables. Each genetic program tries to minimize MSE of predicting target, thus trying to save as much information as possible in a single output variable constructed on a subset of all features. We will use one of the variations of the genetic algorithms to create an operation tree minimizing our goal. Before we fit final model, that is orinary linear regression, first we select a proper transformed variables. Final linear regression, is calculated on the transformed and selected variables at the very end. Summarizing, each operation tree calculates one variable, but this variable is not guaranteed to be included at the end. To avoid strong corelation we decided to use similar trick to one used in random forest. Each GP is trained only on some subset of all variables. Using boostrap is also a good idea, though we did not test it. If data has got low dimensionality, then you can consider using all possible subsets of variables of fixed size. Otherwise, you can randomly choose them. This process results in a many output variables, so we choose final transformed features using LASSO regression or BIC. This method should find much better solutions without extending dimensionality too much or making too complex transformations. We will get linear regression with much better performance without loss of the interpretability. Whole conception tries to automate feature enginnering done traditionally by hand. Another advantage is control of model complexity. We can stimulate how the operation trees are made, for instance, how the operations set looks like. There is also a possibilty of reducing or increasing complexity at will. Modification of this idea is to add regularization term decreasing survival probability with increasing complexity. At the end model could also make a feature selection in the same way - then one of possible operations in the set would be dropping. 3.5.4.2 Feature importance metric The most natural feature importance metric for linear models such as linear regression and GLM are the absolute values of coefficients. Let \\(x_1, \\dots, x_n\\) denote the features (column vectors) and \\(\\hat{y}\\) denote the prediction. In linear models we have: \\[c + \\sum_{i=1}^n a_i \\cdot x_i = \\hat{y}\\] where \\(c\\) is a constant (intercept) and \\(a_i\\) are the coefficients of regression. Formally, the Feature Importance mesaure value of the \\(i-\\)th feature (\\(FI_i\\)) measure is given as: \\[FI_i = |a_i|\\] We may also notice that: \\[FI_i = \\Big|\\frac{\\partial \\hat{y_i}}{\\partial x_i}\\Big|\\] We wish to generalize the above equation. Transforming the data in the dataset to improve the model’s performance may be expressed as generating a new dataset, where each column is a function of all the features present in the original dataset. If the newdataset has \\(m\\) features and the new prediction vector is given as \\(\\dot{y}\\), we then have: \\[d + \\sum_{i=1}^m b_i \\cdot f_i (x_1, \\dots, x_n) = \\dot{y}\\] where \\(d\\) is the new intercept constant and \\(b_i\\) are the coefficients of regression. We therefore may use the formula above to derive a new Feature Importance Measure (Derivative Feature Importance, \\(DFI\\)) as: \\[DFI_{i, j} = \\Big|\\frac{\\partial \\dot{y_i}}{\\partial x_{i, j}}\\Big| = \\Big|b_i \\cdot \\sum_{k=1}^m \\frac{\\partial f_k}{\\partial x_{i, j}}\\Big|\\] The above measure is calculated separately for each observation \\(j\\) in the dataset. However, due to the additive properties of derivatives, we may calculated Derivative Feature Importance of the \\(i\\)-th feature as: \\[DFI_i = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{j=1}^n DFI_{i, j}\\] which is then a global measure of Feature Importance of the \\(i\\)-th feature. 3.5.4.3 Dataset and model performance evaluation The research is conducted on Concrete_Data dataset from the OpenML database [link]. The data describes the amount of ingredients in the samples - cement, blast furnace slag, fly ash, water, coarse aggregate and fine aggregate - in kilograms per cubic meter; it also contains the drying time of the samples in days, referred to as age. The target variable of the dataset is the compressive strength of each sample in megapascals (MPa), therefore rendering the task to be regressive. The dataset contains 1030 instances with no missing values. There are also no symbolic features, as we aim to investigate continuous transformations of the data. Due to the fact, that we focus on the linear regression model, the data is reduced prior to training. We remove the outliers and influential observarions based on Cook’s distances and standardized residuals. We use standard and verified methods to compare results of the models. As the target variable is continuous, we may calculate Mean Square Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R-squared measures for each model, which provide us with proper and measurable way to compare the models’ performances. The same measures may be applied to black box models. The most natural measure of feature importance for linear regression are the coefficients’ absolute values after training the model - however, such easily interpretable measures are not available for black-box models. We therefore measure their feature importance with permutational feature importance measure and caluclating drop-out loss, easily applicable to any predictive model and therefore not constraining us to choose from a restricted set. In order to provide unbiased results, we calculate the measures’ values during cross-validation process for each model, using various number of fold to present comparative results. 3.5.5 Results FIGURE 3.1: MAE of the models after transformations FIGURE 3.2: MSE of the models after transformations The plots presented above show the values of MAE and MSE achieved by each model on the datasets after the mentioned transformation. We may observe, that linear models have significantly reduced their error values after the transformations, while the brute force method yielded best results. However, the Bayesian optimization, trial-and-error method and genetic modifications also provided much improvement in comparison with the models’ performance on the plain dataset. The linear models were finally able to achieve results comparable to SVM performance on the unchanged data. 3.5.6 Summary and conclusions 3.6 Surpassing black box model’s performance on unbalanced data with an interpretable one using advanced feature engineering Authors: Witold Merkel, Adam Rydelek, Michał Stawikowski (Warsaw University of Technology) 3.6.1 Abstract Explainability is the most talked about topic of modern predictive models. The article touches on the topic of such models and their benefits. The main focus is to prove that even on complicated data, explainable models can achieve comparable performance to the best black-box models. Not only are there described strategies allowing better results but also greater explainability. The dataset used in experiments is the adult dataset from OpenML which is from Census database. During the experiments there are multiple processing techniques used, SAFE and different imputation methods among others. Every tool used is explained and the results gained from each part are shown and explained. Thanks to the fact that adult dataset is vastly unbalanced there is a perfect opportunity to present techniques which can be used to handle such tasks. All those methods combined allow for a presentation of a clear workflow enhancing explainable models performance with emphasis on decision tree models. The best results we achieved with decision tree model using methods mentioned above. However at first the best score was achieved by logistic regression, which from the start beat the black boxes. On the other hand it was not possible to tune it, to get it any better. For this reason, our final model is a decision tree, that despite starting as one of the worst surpasses all of the other boxes white and black. This shows that everything can be accomplished with adequate feature engineering, while keeping them explainable. 3.6.2 Introduction and Motivation Recently, an increase in demand of interpretable models can be seen. Machine learning models have gained in popularity in recent years among many fields of business science, industry and also more and more often in medicine. Interpretability is a quickly growing part of machine learning, and there have been many works examining all of the aspects of interpretations. (Murdoch 2018) The problem, however, turned out to be blackbox models, which did not provide sufficient information about the motivation in making specific decisions by the models. Some of machine learning models are considered as black boxes. This means that we can get accurate predictions from them, but we give up the ability of clearly explaining or identifying the logic behind these decisions. (Pandey 2019) Interpretability of models is a desirable feature among specialists in fields other than machine learning, it helps them make better decisions, justify their choices, and combine expert knowledge with the model’s indications. Humans and computers work differently in how they sense, understand and learn. Machines deals with large volume of data and finding hidden patterns in it and people are better at seeing the bigger picture and finding high-level patterns. (accenture 2018) Trust and transparency are also demanded. There are many methods that can help us create an interpretable model. One of the ways to achieve interpretability is to use only a certain subset of algorithms that create interpretable models. Some of the algorithms considered to be interpretable are: linear regression, logistic regression, decision trees or K Nearest Neighbours (KNN). (Molnar 2019) Another way may be to use blackboxes to create an interpretable model. They can help us during transformation of the original data set or, for example, in selecting variables. In this article, we will discuss the process of creating an interpretable model whose target effectiveness will be comparable to blackbox models. We will present the whole workflow, during which we will get acquainted with the dataset with which we will work, we will use advanced feature engineering methods and compare the results obtained during all phases of process. An additional problem we will face during work will be unbalanced data and creating a model that will take them into account during prediction. We will use machine learning tools and frameworks available in R and Python. 3.6.3 Data The dataset used is the adult dataset from OpenML. The original data comes from UCI and was extracted by Barry Becker from the 1994 Census database. The task is to predict whether a given adult makes more than $50,000 a year based attributes such as: age, race, sex, education, native country, work class, weekly work hours, capital gain, capital loss, proximation for the demographic background of people, relationship, marital status, occupation. In the above mentioned dataset we can observe a problem with target class distribution which is vastly unbalanced. The ratio of positive and negative values is around one to four. The dataset has overall of more than forty eight thousand observations and fifteen features, some of which are scarce. 3.6.4 Related work Many works concerning Explainable Artificial Intelligence have arose during the last few years as the topic got more and more popular. [Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI): Concepts, Taxonomies, Opportunities and Challenges toward Responsible AI] (Alejandro Barredo Arrieta 2019) is a paper about XAI in general and many challenges concerning the topic. The article addresses all kinds of easily explainable models which set our focus on enhancing kNN and decision tree based models. [SAFE ML: Surrogate Assisted Feature Extraction For Model Learing] (Gosiewska et al. 2019) on the hand focuses on using Black Box models as surrogate models for improving explainable models. 3.6.5 Methodology As mentioned before we are going to work on an unbalanced dataset. In order to handle this issue and achieve the best possible results during our future work we are going to use two measures: AUPRC and AUC. The former one is designed to take the lack of balance into account. The dataset will be divided into two partitions using stratification in order to handle scarce factor levels. The training part of the dataset is going to be used to compare the effects of many processes used to enhance the results. We are going to use five fold cross-validation. The final results are going to be presented using the test dataset. Our workflow can be divided into the following steps: 3.6.5.1 EDA In this part we have gotten accustomed with the dataset. We started with feature distribution and definition analysis and studied the dependency of other variables on the target class. The column correlation was also taken into account. 3.6.5.1.1 Distribution of numeric variables Data distribution On this plot we can see the distribution of numeric variables. Some of them are normally distributed but there are also highly skewed variables such as capital-gain and capital-loss. 3.6.5.1.2 Correlation plot of numeric variables Correlation On this plot we can observe that the numeric variables have weak correlations with each other. 3.6.5.1.3 Density of observations by age and education Density We can see the density of observations divided by age and education-num features. Education-num is a numeric variable that depicts the education level in an ordered way. 3.6.5.1.4 Level of education by target class Education We can observe that the highest rate of positive target class is for PHD and professors which does not surprise. 3.6.5.1.5 Work class by target class Work class The highest rate when divided by work class can be observed for self-employed people. 3.6.5.1.6 Age by target class Age The density of people earning more than $50000 is skewed toward the elderly. 3.6.5.2 Initial Data Preparation The main focus of this part is to analyze and input the missing data. The side tasks are handling outliers and transformation of skewed variables using logistic functions. A few most popular imputation methods will be compared. We are not only going to use basic aggregation functions like mean and mode but also other machine learning models and advance imputation methods like (Stef van Buuren 2011). The results are going to be compared using a model that is robust to missing data which is a basic decision tree. 3.6.5.2.1 Missing Data by Feature Missing Data Missing data can be observed in three columns. They account up to eight percent of data. 3.6.5.2.2 Missing Data Pattern Missing Data Pattern The bottom figure shows relation between missing variables, when a certain variables is absent in correspondence to other. 3.6.5.2.3 Imputation Results Imputation type AUPRC AUC none 0.6457237 0.8357408 Mean and mode basic imputation 0.6472785 0.8362379 KNN imputation 0.6547221 0.838437 MICE imputation 0.6452505 0.834577 Missing data removal 0.6515376 0.8355305 We can observe that the best results were achieved using KNN imputation so from now on this will be the used method. 3.6.5.2.4 Outliers Missing Data Some outliers can be observed in fnlwgt columns which is described as proximation for the demographic background of people. The data was cropped to 300000 value. 3.6.5.2.5 Skewness Skewness of fnlwgt The previously mentioned feature was also skewed. The solution for this problem was a basic logistic transformation. Transformation of fnlwgt The transformation was successful and the new feature has an appropriate distribution. 3.6.5.3 Feature Engineering and Tuning Firstly we are going to compare a few most popular Machine Learning models on our initially prepared dataset. We picked three popular explainable models: KNN, Decision Tree and Logistic Regression. 3.6.5.3.1 First comparison of models First results The best result was achieved by logistic regression which was surprising and shows how capable explainable models can be even on complex data, non of later modifications had any impact on the model so we decided to exclude it from further considerations. The next best explainable model ranked by AUPRC was KNN and Decision Tree. Due to the fact that logistic regression obtained a better result than black boxes at the very start, and the KNN model is not globally interpretable, we will focus on the decision tree, which is a popular and easily interpretable model. That is the reason why we are going to work mainly with this model and initially with KNN for comparison in our goal to achieve similar results to Black Box models using it, but our final model will be a decision tree. The best Black boxes were Random Forest and Adaboost, because of that in the later phase of our project we will depend on them to make our results better. During the Feature Engineering we will utilize strategies such as transforming and extracting features using the SAFE algorithm mentioned in the article above. Amongst other strategies we will use variable selection based on random forest feature importance and tuning models with Bayesian optimization - mlrMBO (Bernd Bischl 2018) based on custom measure: AUPRC and not the typical AUC. Another interesting aspect that we are going to look into is changing the type of target to numeric and by doing so changing our task from classification to regression, surprisingly it improves our results. 3.6.5.3.2 rSAFE The SAFE ML algorithm uses a complex model as a surrogate. New binary features are created on the basis of surrogate predictions. These new features are used to train a simple refined model. (…) method that uses elastic black-boxes as surrogate models to create a simpler, less opaque, yet still accurate and interpretable glass-box models. New models are created on newly engineered features extracted/learned with the help of a surrogate model. (Gosiewska et al. 2019) To extract new variables we will use rSAFE, which will depend on two different Black Box models: Random Forest and Adaboost. Those models were tuned to increase the final result. Based on the initial variables and the new ones created by the rSafe algorithm, we will choose the combination that will be the best for this problem. We will achieve this by analyzing various values ​​of the “regularization penalty” parameter in the data extraction algorithm in the rSafe package and choosing the one that gives us the best result. Model From AUPRC To AUPRC From AUC To AUC decision tree 0.655 0.674 0.842 0.851 knn 0.698 0.706 0.859 0.868 From the above table it can be observed that this method gave us a significant improvement in terms of AUC and AUPRC. New variables that were extracted and chosen with penalty regularization are: “age_new” - new levels: (-Inf, 32] and (32, Inf), “fnlwgt_new” - new levels: (-Inf, 11.70863] and (11.70863, Inf), \"hours.per.week_new - new levels: (-Inf, 40] and (40, Inf), “race_new” - new levels: White_Asian-Pac-Islander and Amer-Indian-Eskimo_Other_Black. 3.6.5.3.3 Change to regression The next approach we chose based on our previous experience with unbalanced datasets is changing our task from classification to regression and by doing so we improved our prediction. Non of later modifications had any impact on the KNN model so we decided to exclude it from further considerations. Model From AUPRC To AUPRC From AUC To AUC decision tree 0.674 0.716 0.851 0.865 In case of KNN there was no visible improvement. 3.6.5.3.4 Variable selection Additionally we carried out a variable selection on those that are currently used. It was based on feature importance from a random forest model, we use ten most important variables from fifteen that were being used before. Model From AUPRC To AUPRC From AUC To AUC decision tree 0.716 0.720 0.865 0.871 The improvement is slight, but because of this operation we are using a less complicated model, so we decided to use it. 3.6.5.3.5 Tuning Last phase was tuning our decision tree model. We based it on mlrMBO, but our method is adjusted to the task. The optimized measure is AUPRC, this proces is slightly different from optimizing AUC. Before using MBO we select the optimal range of parameters like: “minsplit” - the minimum number of observations that must exist in a node in order for a split to be attempted. and “minbucket” - the minimum number of observations in any terminal node.. After selecting ten optimal values of the first one we select ten optimal for the second. For each of those hundred pairs we use MBO to find the optimal “cp” - complexity parameter. Any split that does not decrease the overall lack of fit by a factor of cp is not attempted. The result we achieved: Model From AUPRC To AUPRC From AUC To AUC decision tree 0.720 0.794 0.871 0.912 Results achieved in this phase are really high, we managed to top those from black boxes and the logistic regression one. 3.6.5.4 Results and conclusion Differences between each stage From the above chart, we can see that thanks to our actions the performance of a fully interpretable model surpassed all basic black boxes and logistic regression, which from the start had really high results. It proves that it is possible to achieve comparable or even better results with interpretable models than black boxes even on unbalanced datasets, such as “adult”. It requires some work, but there are a lot of methods that make it possible to improve our performance. Some of them may be based on very well-functioning black box models. Probably in comparison with tuned black box model, we would achieve lesser results, but interpretable models have an advantage, people can understand why some choices were made and can be safely use when transparency and ease of understanding are needed. Using models such as logistic regression or decision trees make it possible. In this paper we showed that models built using these algorithms after some modifications are able to get similar results to such powerful models as random forest or adaboost, and even artificial deep neural networks. 3.7 Which Neighbours Affected House Prices in the ’90s? Authors: Hubert Baniecki, Mateusz Polakowski (Warsaw University of Technology) 3.7.1 Introduction Real estate value varies over numerous factors. These may be obvious like location or interior design, but also less apparent like the ethnicity and age of neighbours. Therefore, property price estimation is a demanding job that often requires a lot of experience and market knowledge. Is or was, because nowadays, Artificial Intelligence (AI) surpasses humans in this task. Interested parties more often use tools like supervised Machine Learning (ML) models to precisely evaluate the property value and gain a competitive advantage. The dilemma is in blindly trusting the prediction given by so-called black-box models. These are ML algorithms that take loads of various real estate data as input and return a house price estimation without giving their reasoning. Black-box complex nature is its biggest strength and weakness at the same time. This trait regularly entails high effectiveness but does not allow for interpretation of model outputs. Because of that, specialists interested in supporting their work with automated ML decision-making are more eager to use white-box models like linear regression or decision trees. These do not achieve state-of-the-art performance efficiently, but instead, provide valuable information about the relationships present in data through model interpretation. For many years houses have been the most popular properties; thus, they are of particular interest for ordinary people. What exact influence had the demographic characteristics of the house neighbourhood on its price in the ’90s? Although in the absence of current technology, it has been hard to answer such question years ago, now we can. In this paper, we perform a case study on the actual US. Census data from 1990 and deliver an interpretable white-box model that estimates the median house price by the region. We present multiple approaches to this problem and choose the best model, which achieves similar performance to complex black-boxes. Finally, using its interpretable nature, we answer various questions that give a new life to this historical data.

Census Bureau. Each record stands for a distinct US. state while the target value is a median house price in a given region. The variables are presented in Table 3.2. TABLE 3.2: Description of variables present in the house_8L dataset. Original name New name Description price price median price of the house in the region P3 house_n total number of households H15.1 avg_room_n average number of rooms in an owner-occupied Housing Units H5.2 forsale_h_pct percentage of vacant Housing Units which are for sale only H40.4 forsale_6mplus_h_pct percentage of vacant-for-sale Housing Units vacant more then 6 months P11.3 age_25_64_pct percentage of people between 25-64 years of age P16.2 family_2plus_h_pct percentage of households with 2 or more persons which are family households P19.2 black_h_pct percentage of households with black Householder P6.4 asian_p_pct percentage of people which are of Asian or Pacific Islander race Furthermore, we will apply our Metodology (Section 4) on a corresponding house_16H dataset, which has the same target but a different set of variables. More correlated variables of a higher variance make it significantly harder to estimate the median house price in a given region. Such validation will allow us to evaluate our model on a more demanding task. The comprehensive description of used data can be found in (“Census dataset” 1996). 3.7.4 Methodology In this section, we are going to focus on developing the best white-box model, which provides interpretability of features. Throughout this case study, we use the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) measure to evaluate the model performance, because we focus on the residuals while the mean of absolute values of residuals is the easiest to interpret. 3.7.4.1 EDA The main conclusions from the Exploratory Data Analysis are as follows: The target value is very skewed (See Figure 3.3). There are 6 percentage and 2 count variables. The dataset has over 22k data points. There are 46 data points with unnaturally looking target value. There are no missing values. FIGURE 3.3: (L) Histogram of the target values. (R) Examplary variable correlation with the target. Therefore we decided that: We will not transform the skewed target because this might provide less interpretability. There are not many possibilities for feature engineering. We can reliably split the data into train and test using 2:1 ratio. We suspect that the target value of 500001 is artificially made, so we remove these outliers. Throughout this case study, we use the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) measure to evaluate the model performance, because we later focus on the residuals while the mean of absolute values of residuals is the easiest to interpret. 3.7.4.2 SAFE The first approach was using the SAFE (Gosiewska et al. 2019) technique to engineer new features and produce a linear regression model. We trained a well-performing black-box ranger (Wright and Ziegler 2017) model and extracted new interpretable features using its Partial Dependence Profiles (Friedman 2000). Then we used these features to craft a new linear model which indeed was better than the baseline linear model by about 10%. It is worth noting that both of these linear models had a hard time succeeding because of target skewness. 3.7.4.3 Divide-and-conquer In this section, we present the main contribution of this paper. The divide-and-conquer idea has many computer science applications, e.g. in sorting algorithms, natural language processing, or parallel computing. We decided to make use of its core principles in constructing the method for fitting the enhanced white-box model. The final result is multiple tree models combined which decisions are easily interpretable. The proposed algorithm presented in the Figure 3.4 is: Divide the target variable with k middle points into k+1 groups. Fit a black-box classifier on train data which predicts the belonging to the i-th group. Use this classifier to divide the train and test data into k+1 train and test subsets. For every i-th subset fit a white-box estimator of target variable on the i-th train data. Use the i-th estimator to predict the outcome of the i-th test data. FIGURE 3.4: The divide-and-conquer algorithm used to construct an enhanced white-box model. pytanie: czy dodawać wypunktowanie w caption schematu? W paper tak, a w książce lepiej wygląda bez (?) The final product is a stacked model with one classifier and k+1 estimators. For the house price task, we chose k = 1, and the middle point was arbitrary chosen as 100k, which divides the data into two groups in about a 10:1 ratio. We used the ranger random forest model as a black-box classifier and the rpart (Therneau and Atkinson 2019) decision tree model as a white-box estimator. Such a solution allows us to achieve competitive performance with interpretable features. 3.7.5 Results 3.7.5.1 Final model TODO add info about the parameters. describe the plot 3.7.5.2 Comparison We next compare our stacked model with baseline ranger and rpart models, respectively referred to as black-box and white-box.

However neural networks are infamous for their complexity and lack of interpretability. On the other hand simple classifiers like KNN have really poor results for complex tasks like image recognition. In this article we will prove that it is possible to get best of both worlds using emmbeddings. 3.8.3 3.8.2 Data We are going to use dataset Fashion-Mnist. Fashion-MNIST is a dataset of Zalando’s article images, consisting of a training set of 60,000 examples and a test set of 10,000 examples. Each example is a 28x28 grayscale image, associated with a label from 10 classes. Classes are following: T-shirt/top Trouser Pullover Dress Coat Sandal Shirt Sneaker Bag Ankle boot. 3.8.4 3.8.3 Methodology The simplest and one of the most robust classifiers is KNN. It doesn’t generalize information, instead it saves training dataset and during prediction it finds the most similar historical observations and predicts label of a new observation based on their labels. However, it not only doesn’t have the capacity to distinguish important features from not important ones, but also to find more complex interactions between variables. One way to improve KNN’s performance is to preced closest neighbour computation with transformation of the space of observations, so that the derivative variables are more meaningful. Such beneficial transformation is called embedding. It can be done in various ways. The question is, whether or not the new classifier is interpretable. We argue, that it is. The main reason is that even if we can’t interpret the embedding part, we can at least provide historical data that our model used to make prediction. Someone could argue, that it can be done with every classifier, just by finding training data that obtains the most similar prediction. However, with our classifier we can say for sure, that prediction were purely made based on the most similar cases in our dataset, which is fundamentally not true about different classifiers. An embedding can be done made in various ways. In this article we will explore different embedding techniques, including: SVD embedding Convolutional Autoencoder K-means embedding 3.8.5 3.8.4 Standard Intepretable Models In this section we will explore use of standard interpretable models and we will try to answer the question, why they are not useful when it comes to computer vision. 3.8.5.1 3.8.4.1 Logistic Regression Logistic regression is basic classification model. We get probablity of belonging to given class by: \\[{\\displaystyle p={\\frac {e^{\\beta _{0}+\\beta _{1}x_{1}+...+\\beta _{n}x_{n}}}{e^{\\beta _{0}+\\beta _{1}x_{1}+...+\\beta _{n}x_{n}}+1}}}\\] where \\(\\beta _{0},\\beta _{1},...,\\beta _{n}\\) are coefficients of logistic regression. We obtain coefficients using gradient descent. Because we have multiple labels so we train 10 diffrent logistic regression models and use softmax function to normalize probablities of belonging to any particular class. We then visualize coeficients as images with bright spots indicating that they are importent. Unfortunately the results look like this: fig. 1: An example of logistic regression weights We get this because logistic regression works more like a sieve. 3.8.5.2 3.8.4.2 Decision Trees Decision trees are very useful interpretable classifiers, however they are suitable when we have very few meaningful dimensions. A tree that does splits based on particular pixels is not a good classifier and it’s explanation provides little knowledge about, why those particular pixels has been chosen. That’s why we will not explore the use of this class of classifiers. 3.8.6 3.8.5 Our Approach In this section we will show alternative to logistic regression and decision trees, that is more interpretable and in the same time has a capacity to obtain significantly better results. 3.8.6.1 3.8.5.1 The KNN Classifier KNN (k nearest neighbours) is a classifier, that doesn’t generalize data. Instead, we keep the training dataset and every time we make a prediction, we calculate distance (for instance euclidean distance) between our new observation and all observations in the training dataset to find k nearest. Prediction is based on their labels. KNN is a robust classifier, that copes with highly non linear data. It’s also interpretable, because we can always show k nearest neighbours, which are an explanation by themselves. It, however, is not flawless. It for instance poorly scales with the size of the training dataset, while in the same time it need, at least in some domains, very big training dataset, as it doesn’t generalize any information. We can significantly improve it’s performance by introducing complex similarity functions. If similarity function is interpretable, we obtain highly interpretable classifier. If not, we get semi interpretable classifier, where we cannot tell, why obsevations are similar according to the model, however we can at least show similar training set examples, based on which prediction has been made. This complex distance functions can be made in many different ways. In this paper we explore functions of a form: \\[distance(Img1, Img2) = d_e(Embedder(Img1), Embedder(Img2))\\] where \\(d_e\\) is euclidean distance, so we simply compute euclidean distance between embeddings of images. Here’s a scheme of KNN classifier: As we can see on fig. n, new image firstly gets embedded and then a standard classification with KNN is made. This type of architecture allowes us to create robust and interpretable classifier. 3.8.6.2 3.8.5.2 Embedding techniques In this section we will explore different embedding techniques. 3.8.6.2.1 3.8.5.2.1 K-means Our problem is supervised one, but we can still use unsupervised aproach to get better results. We use K-means algorithm (also known as Lloyd’s algorithm) to find subclasses in every class. Algorithm: Initiate number of random centroids For every observation find nearest centroid Calculate average of observations in every group found in point 2 This averages becomes new centroids Repeat points 2 to 4 until all new centroids are at the distance less then \\(\\epsilon\\) from old centroids We use euclidean distance. Prediction for every new observation is simply class of nearest centroid. Algorithm is interpretable, because we can visualise centroids as images. Thanks to using K-means to find subclasses our images are not blurry. Also because number of all subclasses is much lower than number of records in data set using KNN only on centroids is much faster. Consider the following dataset: fig : An example of centroid image In fact, a good subset of the training data set is enough to create a very good classifier. For instance we can choose: fig : An example of centroid image Chosen points approximate sufficiently training data distribution. Notice, that we in fact don’t have to choose particular observations. We can instead chose points in observation space that are similar to observations. This is what k-means algorithm do and so, we can obtain good training data approximation using k-means. Here’s an example of a centroid image: fig : An example of a centroid image 3.8.6.2.2 3.8.5.2.2 SVD SVD is a standard method of dimensionality reduction. It is rewriting \\(m\\times n\\) matrix \\(M\\) as \\(U\\Sigma V^T\\) where \\(U\\) is \\(m\\times m\\) orthonormal matrix, \\(V^T\\) is \\(n\\times n\\) orthonormal matrix and \\(\\Sigma\\) is \\(m\\times n\\) rectangular diagonal matrix with non-negative real numbers on the diagonal. We assume that singular values of \\(\\Sigma\\) are in descending order. Now by taking first columns of \\(V^T\\) we get vectors which are the most relevent. Let \\(V_n\\) be matrix, whoose columns are \\(V\\) columns with n greatest eigenvalues. Such matrix is linear transformation matrix, that turns observations into their embeddings. It can be shown, that \\(V_n\\) is the best transformation in L2 norm sense. We can then visualise this vectors and see which parts of the picture are the most importent. Also we can reduce number of dimensions for KNN. Most importenet vector Image from Dataset Image after using vector as filter 3.8.6.2.3 3.8.5.2.3 Convolutional Autoencoder We can create semi interpretable model by training a convolutional autoencoder and then creating KNN classifier on pretrained embeddings. As mentioned previously, it has several advantages over KNN, because it uses euclidean distance in more meaningful space. Embedder is not interpretable, but our classifier can at least show us historical observations, that had an impact on prediction, which sometimes is good enough, especially when it can be easily seen why two images are similar and we only want a computer to do humans work. For instance, if we provide 5 images of coala that caused that our image of coala has been interpreted as coala, we maybe don’t know, why those images are similar according to our classifier, however we can see, that they are similar, so further explanation of a model is not required. This model, again, is not fully interpretable. Our implementation of convolutional autoencoder consist of the following layers: Conv2d: Input Channels: 1 Output Channels: 50 filter size: 5 Conv2d: Input Channels: 50 Output Channels: 50 filter size: 5 Conv2d: Input Channels: 50 Output Channels: 10 filter size: 5 Conv2d: Input Channels: 10 Output Channels: 10 filter size: 5 Conv2d: Input Channels: 10 Output Channels: 1 filter size: 5 Conv2d: Input Channels: 1 Output Channels: 10 filter size: 5 Conv2d: Input Channels: 10 Output Channels: 10 filter size: 5 Conv2d: Input Channels: 10 Output Channels: 50 filter size: 5 Conv2d: Input Channels: 50 Output Channels: 50 filter size: 5 Conv2d: Input Channels: 50 Output Channels: 1 filter size: 5 along with pooling and unpooling beetween. fig. : Architecture of the convolutional autoencoder 3.8.7 3.8.6 Black-Box Convolutional Neural Networks Classical approach in computer vision is to use convolutional neural networks. A standard artificial neural network sees all variables as being independent from each other. It doesn’t capture the same patterns across image space, nor it recognises, that two pixels next to each other are somehow related. Shifted image is something completly different to a standard neural network from it’s original. Therefore, training a standard neural network is tricky, it requires very big dataset and takes a lot of time. There is, however, a smarter approach that has a capacity to cope with those problems. Namely, convolutional neural networks. A convolutional neural network is an artificial neural network, that tries to capture spacial dependencies between variables, for instance dimensions of pixels that are close to each other. It does that via introducing convolution. The easiest interpretation of convolutional neural network is that instead of training training big network that uses all variables (in our case all pixels), we train smaller transformation with smaller number of variables (smaller subset of pixels close to each other), that we use in many different places on the image. In some sense we train filters. Every filter produces a corresponding so called “channel”. After first layer we can continue filtering channels using convolutional layers. We place a danse layer (or a number of them) at the end and it’s result is our prediction. For further reading, please see … . Having a very good performance, they are impossible to explain. There are some techniques of visualising filters, however more complex networks are generally uninterpretable. Along with standard artificial neural network, we will use it as an instance of robust classifier for comparing results. Our implementation of convolutional neural networks consist of the following layers: Conv 2d: Input Channels: 1 Output Channels: 50 filter size: 5 Max Pool: Size: 2 Conv 2d: Input Channels: 50 Output Channels: 70 filter size: 5 Max Pool: Size: 2 Conv 2d: Input Channels: 70 Output Channels: 100 filter size: 5 Max Pool: Size: 2 Conv 2d: Input Channels: 100 Output Channels: 150 filter size: 5 Linear: Input_size: 1350 Output_size: 500 Linear: Input_size: 200 Output_size: 10 Here’s architecture’s visualisation: 3.8.8 Results Model ACC Black-Box Convolutional 0.941 Logistic regression 0.847 KNN base 0.8606 KNN SVD 0.8001 KNN K-means 0.8512 KNN Convolutional 0.902 3.8.9 Conclusions 3.8.10 Bibliography References "],
